[Skyvern](https://www.skyvern.com) automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual workflows on a large number of websites, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/geico_shu_recording_cropped.gif"/>
</p>

Traditional approaches to browser automations required writing custom scripts for websites, often relying on DOM parsing and XPath-based interactions which would break whenever the website layouts changed.

Instead of only relying on code-defined XPath interactions, Skyvern relies on prompts in addition to computer vision and LLMs to parse items in the viewport in real-time, create a plan for interaction and interact with them.

This approach gives us a few advantages:

1. Skyvern can operate on websites it‚Äôs never seen before, as it‚Äôs able to map visual elements to actions necessary to complete a workflow, without any customized code
1. Skyvern is resistant to website layout changes, as there are no pre-determined XPaths or other selectors our system is looking for while trying to navigate
1. Skyvern is able to take a single workflow and apply it to a large number of websites, as it‚Äôs able to reason through the interactions necessary to complete the workflow
1. Skyvern leverages LLMs to reason through interactions to ensure we can cover complex situations. Examples include:
    1. If you wanted to get an auto insurance quote from Geico, the answer to a common question ‚ÄúWere you eligible to drive at 18?‚Äù could be inferred from the driver receiving their license at age 16
    1. If you were doing competitor analysis, it‚Äôs understanding that an Arnold Palmer 22 oz can at 7/11 is almost definitely the same product as a 23 oz can at Gopuff (even though the sizes are slightly different, which could be a rounding error!)

# How it works
Skyvern was inspired by the Task-Driven autonomous agent design popularized by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) -- with one major bonus: we give Skyvern the ability to interact with websites using browser automation libraries like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Skyvern uses a swarm of agents to comprehend a website, and plan and execute its actions:
1. **Interactable Element Agent**: This agent is responsible for parsing the HTML of a website and extracting the interactable elements. 
2. **Navigation Agent**: This agent is responsible for planning the navigation to complete a task. Examples include clicking buttons, inserting text, selecting options, etc.
3. **Data Extraction Agent**: This agent is responsible for extracting data from a website. It's capable of reading the tables and text on the page, and extracting the output in a user-defined structured format
4. **Password Agent**: This agent is responsible for filling out password forms on a website. It's capable of reading the username and password from a password manager, and filling out the form while preserving the privacy of the user-defined secrets.
5. **2FA Agent**: This agent is responsible for filling out 2FA forms on a website. It's capable of  intercepting website requests for 2FAs, and either requesting user-defined APIs for 2FA codes or waiting for users to feed 2FA codes into it, and then completing the login process.
6. **Dynamic Auto-complete Agent**: This agent is responsible for filling out dynamic auto-complete forms on a website. It's capable of reading the options presented to it, selecting the appropriate option based on the user's input, and adjusting its inputs based on the feedback from inside the form. Popular examples include: Address forms, university dropdowns, and more.

# Skyvern Cloud
We offer a managed cloud version of Skyvern that allows you to run Skyvern without having to manage the infrastructure. It allows you to run multiple Skyvern instances in parallel to automate your workflows at scale. In addition, Skyvern cloud comes bundled with anti-bot detection mechanisms, proxy network, and CAPTCHA solving to allow you to complete more complicated workflows.

If you'd like to try it out, 
1. Navigate to [app.skyvern.com](https://app.skyvern.com)
1. Create an account & Get $5 of credits on us
1. Kick off your first task and see Skyvern in action!

Here are some tips that may help you on your adventure:
1. Skyvern is really good at carrying out a single goal. If you give it too many instructions to do, it has a high likelihood of getting confused along the way. 
2. Being really explicit about goals is very important. For example, if you're generating an insurance quote, let it know very clearly how it can identify it has accomplished its goals. Use words like "COMPLETE" or "TERMINATE" to indicate success and failure modes, respectively.
3. Workflows can be used if you'd like to do more advanced things such as chaining multiple instructions together, or securely logging in. If you need any help with this, please feel free to book some time with us! We're always happy to help

# Supported Functionality
## Skyvern Tasks
Tasks are the fundamental building block inside Skyvern. Each task is a single request to Skyvern, instructing it to navigate through a website and accomplish a specific goal. 

Tasks require you to specify a `url`, `navigation_goal`, and optionally `data_extraction_goal` if you'd like to extract data from the website, and a `navigation_payload` if you'd like to provide additional context to help Skyvern fill information or answer questions presented by a website.

  <img src="docs/images/task_creation_form_example.png"/>
</p>


## Skyvern Workflows
Workflows are a way to chain multiple tasks together to form a cohesive unit of work. 

For example, if you wanted to download all invoices newer than January 1st, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the invoices page, then filtered down to only show invoices newer than January 1st, extracted a list of all eligible invoices, and iterated through each invoice to download it.

Another example is if you wanted to automate purchasing products from an e-commerce store, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the desired product, then added it to a cart. Second, it would navigate to the cart and validate the cart state. Finally, it would go through the checkout process to purchase the items.

Supported workflow features include:
1. Tasks (+ chained tasks)
1. Loops
1. File parsing
1. Uploading files to block storage
1. Sending emails
1. Text Prompts
1. (Coming soon) Conditionals
1. (Coming soon) Custom Code Block

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/invoice_downloading_workflow_example.png"/>
</p>

## Livestreaming
Skyvern allows you to livestream the viewport of the browser to your local machine so that you can see exactly what Skyvern is doing on the web. This is useful for debugging and understanding how Skyvern is interacting with a website, and intervening when necessary

## Form Filling
Skyvern is natively capable of filling out form inputs on websites. Passing in information via the `navigation_goal` or `navigation_payload` will allow Skyvern to comprehend the information and fill out the form accordingly.

## Data Extraction
Skyvern is also capable of extracting data from a website. Specifying a `data_extraction_goal` will allow Skyvern to extract the data and return it to you in the response.

You can also specify a `data_extraction_schema` to tell Skyvern exactly what data you'd like to extract from the website, in jsonc format. Skyvern's output will be structured in accordance to the supplied schema.

## File Downloading
Skyvern is also capable of downloading files from a website. Specifying a `file_download_goal` will allow Skyvern to download the file and return a link to the file in the response.

## Authentication
Skyvern supports a number of different authentication methods to make it easier to automate tasks behind a login. 

### Password Manager Integrations
Skyvern currently supports the following password manager integrations:
- [x] Bitwarden 
- [ ] 1Password
- [ ] LastPass

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/secure_password_task_example.png"/>
</p>

### 2FA
Skyvern supports a number of different 2FA methods to allow you to automate workflows that require 2FA. 

Examples include:
1. QR-based 2FA (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy) 
1. Email based 2FA
1. SMS based 2FA
