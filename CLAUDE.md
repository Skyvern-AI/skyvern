# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Python Backend Commands
- **Install dependencies**: `poetry install`
- **Run Skyvern service**: `skyvern run all` (starts both backend and UI)
- **Run backend only**: `skyvern run server`
- **Run UI only**: `skyvern run ui`
- **Check status**: `skyvern status`
- **Stop services**: `skyvern stop all`
- **Quickstart**: `skyvern quickstart` (for first-time setup with DB migrations)

### Code Quality & Testing
- **Lint**: `ruff check` and `ruff format`
- **Type checking**: `mypy skyvern`
- **Run tests**: `pytest tests/`
- **Pre-commit hooks**: `pre-commit run --all-files`

### Frontend Commands (in skyvern-frontend/)
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
- **Development**: `npm run dev`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Format**: `npm run format`

### Database Management
- **Run migrations**: `alembic upgrade head`
- **Create migration**: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`

## Architecture Overview

Skyvern is a browser automation platform that uses LLMs and computer vision to interact with websites. The architecture consists of:

### Core Components
- **Agent System** (`skyvern/agent/`): Multi-agent system for web navigation and task execution
- **Browser Engine** (`skyvern/webeye/`): Playwright-based browser automation with computer vision
- **Workflow Engine** (`skyvern/services/`): Orchestrates complex multi-step workflows
- **API Layer** (`skyvern/forge/`): FastAPI-based REST API and WebSocket support

### Key Directories
- `skyvern/agent/`: LLM-powered agents for web interaction
- `skyvern/webeye/`: Browser automation, DOM scraping, action execution
- `skyvern/forge/`: FastAPI server, API endpoints, request handling
- `skyvern/services/`: Business logic for tasks, workflows, and browser sessions
- `skyvern/cli/`: Command-line interface
- `skyvern/client/`: Generated Python client SDK
- `skyvern-frontend/`: React-based UI for task management and monitoring
- `alembic/`: Database migrations

### Workflow System
- **Blocks**: Modular components (navigation, extraction, validation, loops, etc.)
- **Parameters**: Dynamic values passed between blocks
- **Runs**: Execution instances of workflows
- **Browser Sessions**: Persistent browser state across workflow steps

### Data Flow
1. User creates tasks/workflows via UI or API
2. Agent system plans actions using LLM analysis of screenshots
3. Browser engine executes actions via Playwright
4. Results are captured, processed, and stored
5. Workflow orchestrator manages multi-step sequences

## Development Notes

### Environment Setup
- Requires Python 3.11+ and Node.js
- Uses Poetry for Python dependency management
- PostgreSQL database (managed via Docker or local install)
- Browser dependencies installed via Playwright

### LLM Configuration
Configure via environment variables or `skyvern init llm`:
- Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Gemini, Ollama
- Uses `LLM_KEY` to specify which model to use
- `SECONDARY_LLM_KEY` for lightweight agent operations

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests in `tests/unit_tests/`
- Integration tests require browser automation setup
- Use `pytest` with async support for testing

### Code Style
- Python: Ruff for linting and formatting (configured in pyproject.toml)
- TypeScript: ESLint + Prettier (configured in skyvern-frontend/)
- Line length: 120 characters
- Use type hints and async/await patterns
