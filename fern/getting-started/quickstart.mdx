## Skyvern Cloud
Sign up on https://app.skyvern.com/ to get $5 free credits and ask the Skyvern agent to run a task for you!

Here are some examples you can try:
- `Navigate to the Hacker News homepage and get the top 3 posts.`
- `Go to google finance and find the "AAPL" stock price. COMPLETE when the search results for "AAPL" are displayed and the stock price is extracted.`

## Python SDK
> ⚠️ **REQUIREMENT**: Skyvern runs with Python 3.11 ⚠️

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

## Run Task
### Run Task On A Skyvern Service
Get your API key from [Skyvern Cloud](https://app.skyvern.com/settings). Send the task to Skyvern Cloud:
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(api_key="YOUR API KEY")
# OR pass the base_url to use any Skyvern service
# skyvern = Skyvern(base_url="http://localhost:8000", api_key="YOUR API KEY")

task = await skyvern.agent.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```
More API & SDK information can be found in the [API Reference](/api-reference) section.

### Run Task Locally
You can also run browser tasks locally in your python code but it takes a bit more effort to set up the environment:

1. **Configure Skyvern** Run the setup wizard which will guide you through the configuration process, including Skyvern [MCP](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern/blob/main/integrations/mcp/README.md) integration. This will generate a `.env` as the configuration settings file.
        ```bash
        skyvern init
        ```

2. **Run Task In Python Code**
        ```python
        from skyvern import Skyvern
        
        skyvern = Skyvern()
        
        task = await skyvern.agent.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
        print(task)
        ```
        A local browser will pop up. Skyvern will start executing the task in the browser and close it when the task is done. You will be able to review the task from http://localhost:8080/history
