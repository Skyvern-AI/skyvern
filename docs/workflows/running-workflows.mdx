## Running workflows

### `POST /workflows/{workflow_permanent_id}/run`

You can see the generic endpoint definition below. We’ll go into the specifics of the invoice retrieval workflow in the next section.

### Body

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Sample Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data | JSON | no | \{ <br/>"website_url": "YOUR_URL",<br/>"invoice_retrieval_start_date": "2024-04-15"<br/> \}, | The data field is used to pass in required and optional parameters that a workflow accepts. For the invoice retrieval workflow, required fields are website_url and invoice_retrieval_start_date |
| webhook_callback_url | String | no | …  | Our system will send the webhook once it is finished executing the workflow run. |
| proxy_location  | String | no | RESIDENTIAL | Proxy location for the web browser. Please pass RESIDENTIAL. <br /> If we use residential proxies, Skyvern’s requests to the websites will be less suspicious. |

### Response

| Parameter | Type | Always returned? | Sample Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| workflow_permanent_id | String | yes | wpid_123456 | The workflow id |
| workflow_run_id | String | yes | wr_123456 | The workflow run id that represents this specific workflow run. <br/> You can use this id to match the webhook response to the initial request. |

}

## Webhooks

Skyvern always sends webhooks when a workflow run is executed. The status for an executed workflow run can be: `completed, failed, terminated`. 

The webhook body is the same as the get workflow run endpoint.

### Webhook Headers

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Sample Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x-skyvern-signature | String | yes | v0=a2114d57b48eac39b9ad189dd8316235a7b4a8d21a10bd27519666489c69b503 | Authentication token that allows our service to communicate with your backend service via callback / webhook <br/> <br/> We’ll be using the same strategy slack uses, as defined here: https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack#making__validating-a-request |
| x-skyvern-timestamp | String | yes | 1531420618 | Timestamp used to decode and validate the incoming webhook call

We’ll be using the same strategy slack uses, as defined here: https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack#making__validating-a-request |

## Explaining `outputs`

If you checked out the sample response, you probably thought “What the heck is this field right here?”.

We previously went over that workflows are essentially a list of building blocks. `outputs` field has the output for every single block that a workflow has. Before we start analyzing the `outputs` from the sample above, let’s go over the building blocks for the invoice retrieval workflow. 

### Building blocks of invoice retrieval workflow:

| # | Block type | Block label | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | TaskBlock | login | Find login page, login to the website |
| 2 | TaskBlock | get_order_history_page_url_and_qualifying_order_ids | Find the order history page, extract order history page url, contact emails, and order details for orders after the start date |
| 3 | ForLoopBlock | iterate_over_order_ids | The contents of the ForLoop is executed for each order id that’s extracted from the previous step. |
| 4 | TaskBlock [within ForLoopBlock] | download_invoice_for_order | For a given order id, find a way to download the invoice, download it. |
| 5 | UploadToS3Block | upload_downloaded_files_to_s3 | Upload all downloaded invoices to S3 |
| 6 | SendEmailBlock | send_email | Send an email attaching all the downloaded invoices |

### ⚠️ Still in development, not a blocker

1. The blocks within the ForLoop show up twice: within the ForLoop output and as a root block.
2. UploadToS3Block output is S3 URIs at the moment. They’ll be updated with signed urls instead.
3. Add block type to each object in `outputs`, define the output structure for each block for easier integration.
