Credit card credentials store payment details so the AI can fill checkout forms without you embedding card numbers in prompts or parameters.

## Creating a credit card credential

Click **+ Add → Credit Card** from the Credentials page. Provide the full card details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|------------|
| **Name** | A label like "Corporate Visa" to identify it later |
| **Cardholder Name** | Name printed on the card |
| **Number** | Full card number (spaces added automatically as you type) |
| **Brand** | Card network: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB, Diners Club, Maestro, UnionPay, RuPay, or Other |
| **Expiration** | Month and year in `MM/YY` format (slash inserted automatically) |
| **CVV** | 3 or 4 digit security code |

After saving, the card number is masked — only the last four digits are ever shown again.

## Using credit cards in workflows

Credit cards work with **Browser Task** and **Browser Action** blocks that interact with checkout pages. The AI identifies payment fields on the page and fills them with the stored details.

To reference a credit card, add a **Credential parameter** (type: `credential_id`) and select the card when running the workflow. This lets the same checkout workflow work with different payment methods.

<Note>
Credit cards from **1Password** need a text field named **"Expire Date"** in `MM/YYYY` format on the 1Password item. See [Credentials Overview](/cloud/managing-credentials/credentials-overview#1password) for details.

## Editing and deleting

Credit card credentials can't be edited after creation. If card details change, delete the old credential and create a new one. Click the **trash icon** to delete — the action is permanent.
