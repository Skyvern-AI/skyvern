Ask the Skyvern agent to run a task and see it in action live! Here are some examples you can try:
- `Navigate to the Hacker News homepage and get the top 3 posts.`
- `Go to google finance and find the "AAPL" stock price. COMPLETE when the search results for "AAPL" are displayed and the stock price is extracted.`

## Python SDK
<Tip title="Supported Python Versions" icon="fa-brands fa-python">
Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13
</Tip>

### Install Skyvern
```bash
pip install skyvern
```

### Run Task On A Skyvern Service
Get your API key from [Skyvern Cloud](https://app.skyvern.com/settings). Send the task to Skyvern Cloud:
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(api_key="YOUR API KEY")
# OR pass the base_url to use any Skyvern service
# skyvern = Skyvern(base_url="http://localhost:8000", api_key="YOUR API KEY")

task = await skyvern.agent.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```
More API & SDK information can be found in the [API Reference](/api-reference) section.

### Run Task Locally
You can also run browser tasks locally in your python code but it takes a bit more effort to set up the environment:

1. **Configure Skyvern** Run the setup wizard which will guide you through the configuration process, including Skyvern [MCP](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern/blob/main/integrations/mcp/README.md) integration. This will generate a `.env` as the configuration settings file.
        ```bash
        skyvern init
        ```

2. **Run Task In Python Code**
        ```python
        from skyvern import Skyvern
        
        skyvern = Skyvern()
        
        task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
        print(task.model_dump())
        ```
        A local browser will pop up. Skyvern will start executing the task in the browser and close the browser when the task is done.
