The Skyvern Workato integration lets you connect Skyvern with Workato's enterprise automation platform.

Use it to trigger browser automation jobs from other tools, or to send Skyvern results into other apps.

---

## What you'll need

- A Skyvern Cloud API key from [Settings](https://app.skyvern.com/settings)

---

## Available Actions

Actions are steps your recipe performs to interact with Skyvern.

| Action | Use this to |
|--------|-------------|
| Create and Run Task | Run an automation using the `skyvern-1.0` engine. Best for simple tasks like filling a form or searching for information. |
| Create and Run Task V2 | Run an automation using the `skyvern-2.0` engine. Best for complex, multi-step goals with dynamic planning. |
| Run a Workflow | Run a pre-built Skyvern workflow by selecting from available workflows and providing dynamic parameters. |
| Get Task | Retrieve the details of a previously run task (v1). |
| Get Task V2 | Retrieve the details of a previously run task (v2). |
| Get Workflow | Retrieve the details of a previously run workflow. |

## Step 4: Set configuration fields

Configuration varies by action type.

### Create and Run a Task

Both task actions use the same configuration fields. The difference is the underlying engine:

- **Create and Run Task** uses `skyvern-1.0` — optimized for simple, single-step goals
- **Create and Run Task V2** uses `skyvern-2.0` — uses dynamic planning for complex, multi-step goals

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| URL | Yes | The starting page for the automation. |
| Navigation Goal | Often | What Skyvern should do on the page. End with "COMPLETE" when done or "TERMINATE" to stop. Omit if only extracting data. |
| Data Extraction Goal | No | What data to extract after navigation completes. Be specific about what to return. |
| Navigation Payload | No | JSON object with input data for forms. Use this to run the same task with different data. |
| Extracted Information Schema | No | JSON schema specifying how extracted data should be formatted. |
| Webhook Callback URL | No | URL to notify when Skyvern finishes executing. |
| Max Steps | No | Limit the number of steps to control costs. |

<Note>
The navigation goal describes what to do *after* loading the URL. Don't include "go to website X" in the navigation goal—use the URL field instead.

### Run a Workflow

First, create your workflow in the [Skyvern UI](https://app.skyvern.com).

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Workflow | Yes | Select the workflow you want to run from the dropdown. |
| Parameters | Depends | Fill in any parameters defined in your workflow. Skip if your workflow uses fixed values. |

### Get Task / Workflow

Use these actions to retrieve the details of a previous run into your recipe. The run must have already completed.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Task ID | Yes | The ID of the task run. Starts with `tsk_`. |
| Workflow Run ID | Yes | The ID of the workflow run. Starts with `wr_`. |

## Step 5: Test

Click **Save** then **Test recipe** to run the flow. Monitor progress in your [Skyvern dashboard](https://app.skyvern.com).
