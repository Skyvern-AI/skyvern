## Navigation Block
This block takes actions with a given navigation goal.

## Action Block
Similar to the navigation block, but this block takes ONLY one action.

## Extract Block
This block extracts information from the website. You can define the data extraction schema with this block. No other actions will be taken.

## Login Block
This block can support most password required login tasks in a website, integrated with [Skyvern Credentials](/credentials/introduction) to make sure your password is never sent to an LLM.

When a website has uncommon login requirements, you should update the default prompt in the block to provide more instructions.

## Validation Block
Like having an assertion in a test, this block validates the state of the workflow. It terminates the workflow if the validation fails. 

## Task Block
This block navigates through the websites to take actions and/or extract information.

## ForLoopBlock
This block supports loop in the workflow.

## Url Block
This block navigates to a given URL.

## Code Block
This block allows you to write any custom python and playwright script to interact with the browser. For Skyvern Cloud, it's an invite only feature.

## TextPromptBlock
This block is a text only prompt block.

## SendEmailBlock
This block sends an email.

## FileDownloadBlock
This block downloads a file from the website.

## FileParserBlock
This block parses PDFs, CSVs, and Excel files from the website.

## PDFParserBlock
This block parses a PDF file from the website.

## FileUploadBlock
This block uploads all the downloaded files to a desired destination. Currently only AWS S3 is supported. Please contact support@skyvern.com if you need more integrations.

## WaitBlock
This block waits for a given amount of time.

## NavigationV2Block (TaskV2Block)
The advanced version of the NavigationBlock, powered by the Skyvern 2.0 engine. Designed for complicated goals.
