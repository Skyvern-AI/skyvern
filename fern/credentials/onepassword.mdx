Skyvern can integrate with your 1Password account via the 1Password CLI. The agent can fetch login credentials on the fly while keeping them secure.

## How to integrate 1Password with Skyvern

1. Install the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/).
2. Create a service account or sign in and generate a session token.
3. Set the environment variables `ONEPASSWORD_TOKEN` and `ONEPASSWORD_VAULT` for Skyvern.
4. Store your credential item IDs in Skyvern just like Bitwarden.

Once configured, Skyvern will retrieve credentials using the 1Password CLI when `PASSWORD_MANAGER=onepassword` is set.
