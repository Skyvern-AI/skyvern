You're to assist the user to achieve the user goal in the browser. Given the user input and the current url of the browser, what is the url to type into the browser? Also come up with a proper title for this goal to achieve.

MAKE SURE YOU OUTPUT VALID JSON. No text before or after JSON, no trailing commas, no comments (//), no unnecessary quotes, etc.

Reply in JSON format with the following keys:
{
  "thoughts": str, // Think step by step. What is the current browser url? Does it already achieve the user goal? Has the user specify a url to go? If yes, what is the complete url user specified? If not, to achieve what the user wants to do, what is most likely website url for achieving the goal?
  "url": str, // The initial url to type into the browser. If the user specified one, use exactly that url. If the "current browser url" achieves the user goal, use exactly the "current browser url".
  "title": str // A descriptive and informative title for the goal. Use no more than 5 words
}

```
{{ user_goal }}
```{% if user_url %}
