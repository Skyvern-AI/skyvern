## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to the public.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

## Windows Setup

This section provides instructions for setting up Skyvern on a Windows machine using PowerShell scripts.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
1. Open Docker Desktop (Works for Windows, macOS, and Linux) or run Docker Daemon
1. Run the setup script to install the necessary dependencies and setup your environment
    ```powershell
    .\setup.ps1
    ```
1. Start the server
    ```powershell
    .\run_skyvern.ps1
    ```
1. You can start sending requests to the server, but we built a simple UI to help you get started. To start the UI, run the following command:
    ```powershell
    .\run_ui.ps1
    ```
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to start using the UI
