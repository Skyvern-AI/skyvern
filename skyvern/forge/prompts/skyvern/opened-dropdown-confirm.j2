There is a screenshot from a part of a web HTML page. Help me confirm if it is an open dropdown menu.

An open dropdown menu can be defined as:
  - At least one option is visible in the screenshot.
  - A calendar view could be considered as an open dropdown menu. But DO NOT consider an calendar icon as the dropdown menu.
  - If the screenshot contains multiple input fields for selecting quantities, consider as the dropdown menu.
  - Do not consider it an open dropdown menu if the only visible option displays a message like "No results" or "No match".
  - Do not consider it an open dropdown menu if the only visible element displays a placeholder like "Please select", "-", or "Select...".

MAKE SURE YOU OUTPUT VALID JSON. No text before or after JSON, no trailing commas, no comments (//), no unnecessary quotes, etc.

Reply in JSON format with the following keys:
{
    "reasoning": str, // the reason why it's a dropdown menu or not a dropdown menu
    "is_opened_dropdown_menu": bool, // true if it's a opened dropdown menu, otherwise false.
}
