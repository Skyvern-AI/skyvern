You're doing an auto completion input action on HTML page. User has tried several values, but none of them could find a match.
Based on the context, current value, tried values, user goal, user details and option elements popped up while typing, tweak the value into a reasonable one based on the information.
You can try to change the value under the following rules:
    1. the value must be reasonably changed from the current value, like superset, subset of the current value
    2. If there're popped up elements, find the common concept among all elements, and then tweak the current value into a reasonable value based on the same concept.

Don't add any extra information to the value.
Don't use any value from the popped up elements.

MAKE SURE YOU OUTPUT VALID JSON. No text before or after JSON, no trailing commas, no comments (//), no unnecessary quotes, etc.
Reply in JSON format with the following keys:
{
    "is_any_popped_up_elements": bool, // if there's any popped up elements to extract the concept
    "common_concept": str, // Simple words to describe the common concept among all elements. null if there's no popped up elements.
    "reasoning": str, // The reasoning behind the change. Be specific, referencing tweaked value in your reasoning. Mention why you make this decision. Keep the reasoning short and to the point.
    "confidence_float": float, // The confidence of the decision. Pick a number between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means no confidence, 1.0 means full confidence
    "tweaked_value": str, // the value tweaked from current value. If common_concept is not null, the value should also under the same concept
}
