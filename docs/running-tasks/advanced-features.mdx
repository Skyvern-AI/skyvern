## Overriding the max_steps paramter in the task
If you want the task to execute for a specific number of steps, you can use the `x-max-steps-override` header in the request. This will override the default `max_steps` parameter set in the task.

```json
POST https://api.skyvern.com/api/v1/tasks 

Headers:
{
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-max-steps-override": 10
}

Body:
.. usual task body ..
```

## Time-based One-time Password (TOTP)

Skyvern supports one-time password (see https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/totp for more information) by fetching it from your endpoint. You can pass `totp_verification_url` when [creating a task](/running-tasks/api-spec#request-initiate-a-task). Inside this endpoint hosted by you, you have to conform to the following schema:

### Set Up Your TOTP Endpoint
For websites that requires a verification code to complete a task, you have to set up a TOTP endpoint for Skyvern to fetch the verification code.

Here's the TOTP endpoint contract you should use:

Request (POST):
| Parameter | Type | Required? | Sample Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| task_id | String | yes | tsk_123 | The task ID that needs the verification to be done |

Response:
| Parameter | Type | Required? | Sample Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| task_id | String | yes | tsk_123 | The task ID that needs the verification to be done |
| verification_code | String | no | 123456 | The verification code |

### Validate The Sender of The Request
Same as the webhook API, your server needs to make sure it’s Skyvern that’s making the request.

- a python example for how to generate and validate the signature:

```python
def validate_skyvern_request_headers(request: Request) -> bool:
    header_skyvern_signature = request.headers["x-skyvern-signature"]
    payload = request.body() # this is a bytes
    hash_obj = hmac.new(SKYVERN_API_KEY.encode("utf-8"), msg=payload, digestmod=hashlib.sha256)
    client_generated_signature = hash_obj.hexdigest()
    return header_skyvern_signature == client_generated_signature
```

SKYVERN_API_KEY: this is the [api key](/running-tasks/introduction) specific to your organization
