You're doing an auto completion input action on HTML page. The current filled value doesn't match any option.
Based on the context, current value, user goal and user details, give ten most potential values with the same meaning as the current value.
You can provide values like:
    - Subset or superset meaning from the current value
    - Summarized from the current value
    - Remove too detailed information, making more general and concise
But don't add any extra information to the value.

MAKE SURE YOU OUTPUT VALID JSON. No text before or after JSON, no trailing commas, no comments (//), no unnecessary quotes, etc.
Reply in JSON format with the following keys:
{
    "potential_values": [
        {
            "reasoning": str, // the reasoning why you recommend this value, including the relationship between the value you recommend and the current value. Keep the reasoning short and to the point.
            "relevance_float": float, // The relative between the target value and the element. Pick a number between 0.00 and 1.00. 0.00 means no relevance, 1.00 means full relevance, the precision is 0.01.
            "value": str, // the value you recommend
        }
    ], // The list of potential values. Sorted by the descending order of relevance_float 
}
