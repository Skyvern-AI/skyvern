Once you've [built a workflow](/cloud/building-workflows/build-a-workflow), the **Workflows** page is where you organize, share, and manage them. Each workflow is a reusable sequence of blocks that you can run with different inputs each time.

Click **Workflows** in the left sidebar to open it.

## The workflows table

The table lists all workflows in your organization with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique workflow identifier |
| **Title** | Display name (click to open in the editor) |
| **Folder** | Folder assignment, if any |
| **Created At** | When the workflow was created |
| **Actions** | Inline buttons and three-dot menu |

Each row also has inline action buttons: folder assignment, parameter toggle, open in editor (pencil icon), run (play icon), and a three-dot menu for additional actions.

---

## Organizing with folders

The top of the page shows your recent folders as cards. Use folders to group related workflows.

- Click **+ New folder** to create one
- Click a folder card to filter the table to that folder's workflows
- Assign a workflow to a folder using the folder icon in the table row
- Click **View all** to see all folders when you have more than five

## Searching and filtering

Use the search bar above the table to filter workflows by title or parameter. The results highlight matching text and auto-expand parameter rows when a parameter matches.

The items-per-page selector at the bottom lets you choose 5, 10, 20, or 50 rows per page.

## Workflow actions

Click the **three-dot menu** on any workflow row to access these actions:

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clone Workflow** | Creates a copy named "Copy of ..." with the original title |
| **Save as Template** | Makes this workflow available in the organization template gallery. A bookmark icon appears next to the title. |
| **Remove from Templates** | Removes the workflow from the template gallery (appears instead of "Save as Template" for templates) |
| **Export as... > YAML** | Downloads the workflow definition as a `.yaml` file |
| **Export as... > JSON** | Downloads the workflow definition as a `.json` file |
| **Delete Workflow** | Opens a confirmation dialog, then permanently deletes the workflow |

<Warning>
Deleting a workflow is permanent. Clone it first if you want to keep a backup.
</Warning>

---

## Importing workflows

Click the **Import** button to upload workflow files.

| Format | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `.yaml` / `.yml` | Parsed and created as a new workflow |
| `.json` | Converted to YAML internally, then created |
| `.pdf` | Sent to the AI to generate a workflow from a Standard Operating Procedure document |

<Tip>
Upload a PDF of your Standard Operating Procedure and Skyvern generates a workflow from it automatically.
