# Getting Started

Automate browser tasks in minutes with Skyvern's no-code workflow builder.

Skyvern Cloud lets you build and run browser automations using Skyvern Agents without writing any code.

Skyvern's AI agents can navigate to websites, search for information, fill out forms, click buttons, and extract data—all from a natural language prompt describing your goal.

You can watch a realtime screenshare as it navigates websites and performs actions.

This guide walks you through the interface and helps you run your first automation.

## Opening Skyvern Cloud

Visit [app.skyvern.com](https://app.skyvern.com) and sign-up or sign-in to your account.

You'll land on the **Discover** page—your starting point for running automations.

## Understanding the Interface

The left sidebar organizes everything you need:

- **Discover** — Run one-off tasks with a prompt and URL
- **Workflows** — Create and manage reusable multi-step automations
- **Runs** — View history of all past executions
- **Browsers** — Manage active browser sessions
- **Agents** — Pre-built templates for common use cases like contact forms, job applications, invoices, and government filings. These are ready-to-run workflows you can customize.
- **Billing** — Usage and subscription management
- **Credentials** — Securely store logins and passwords
- **Settings** — API keys and account configuration

### When to use the UI vs API/SDK

The Cloud UI is ideal for building workflows visually, running one-off tasks, and monitoring executions. Use the API or SDK when you need to trigger automations programmatically or integrate Skyvern into your own applications.

## Run Your First Task

The fastest way to see Skyvern in action is to run a task directly from the Discover page.

### Step 1: Enter your prompt

<img src="../images/cloud/discover-page.png" />

In the main input field, describe what you want to accomplish.

<Tip title="Prompting tip" icon="lightbulb">
Be specific about the goal, completion criteria, visual indicators, and all necessary data.
</Tip>

Check out our detailed [Prompting Guide](/prompting-guide).

**Example prompts:**

- "Find the top post on Hacker News and extract its title"
- "Search for 'wireless headphones' on Amazon and get the first 3 product names and prices"
- "Fill out the contact form on {url} with name: John Doe, email: john@example.com"

You can also select one of the quick-action buttons below the input for common example tasks like "Add a product to cart" or "Get an insurance quote."

### Step 2: Configure settings (optional)

Click the gear icon to access additional options:

- **Proxy Location** — This changes where your browser automations run. Use this to access websites blocked in a specific country.
- **Browser Session ID** — Use this to set a common identifier between different workflows that require common login sessions or need cookies
- **2FA Identifier** — Skyvern handles 2FA if you provide the identifier for a two-factor authentication (2FA) code. Use this to access accounts protected by 2FA.
- **Publish Workflow** — This saves the current task run into a workflow template you can re-use later on
- **Data Schema** — Use this to specify an output data schema to get structured output that you can use in multi-step automations

### Step 3: Run the task

Click the send button to start.

In the background, Skyvern opens a browser, navigates to the URL you specified (or finds it using search), and interacts with the website component to get the job done.

## Watch the Live Browser

Once your task starts, you'll see the execution screen with two main panels:

<img src="../images/cloud/live-browser-view.png" />

**Left panel: Task configuration**

Shows the block being executed with its URL and prompt. The status badge indicates whether the task is running, completed, or failed.

**Right panel: Live Browser**

A real-time view of the browser as Skyvern navigates. You'll see pages load, forms fill, and buttons click—exactly as if you were doing it yourself.

The **"take control"** button lets you intervene and use the agent's browser yourself if it needs help with something unexpected, like a CAPTCHA or unusual login flow.

## Review the Results

After the task completes, you can go to the **Runs** page and open the latest task run.

This is where you'll find everything Skyvern captured.

### Output

The extracted data appears at the top in JSON format. This matches the schema you defined (or a sensible default if you didn't specify one).

```json
{
  "top_post": {
    "title": "Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work"
  }
}
```

### Overview

View the browser screenshot, agent's thought process with decisions, and extraction results with detailed reasoning for each action taken

### Output

See the structured JSON output from the task, workflow run status information, and any downloaded files from the automation

### Parameters

Configure workflow settings including webhook callbacks, proxy location, HTTP headers, and the original task prompt used

### Recording

Watch a full video replay of the browser session showing exactly how the agent navigated and interacted with the website

### Code

Access the complete Python SDK code with workflow definitions, parameters, and extraction schemas to reproduce this task programmatically

### AI Reasoning

The right sidebar shows the agent's thought process, actions taken, tools used and data extracted.
