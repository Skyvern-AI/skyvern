### Example Request

Using cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.skyvern.com/api/v1/organizations" \
     -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"
```

Using Python with the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.skyvern.com/api/v1/organizations"
headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    organizations = response.json()["organizations"]
    for org in organizations:
        print(f"Organization ID: {org['organization_id']}")
        print(f"Organization Name: {org['organization_name']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```

Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API Key retrieved from Skyvern's setting page
