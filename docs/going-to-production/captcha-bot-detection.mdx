Skyvern detects CAPTCHAs using its vision model and solves them automatically.

However, CAPTCHA solving is not guaranteed. Skyvern's solvers can fail on novel challenges or rate-limited IPs.

This guide helps you detect CAPTCHA failures and implement fallbacks to keep your automation running smoothly.

**Supported CAPTCHA types:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| `RECAPTCHA` | Google reCAPTCHA v2, v3 |
| `HCAPTCHA` | hCaptcha checkbox, image challenges |
| `CLOUDFLARE` | Cloudflare Turnstile, Challenge pages |
| `FUNCAPTCHA` | FunCaptcha / ArkoseLabs |
| `MTCAPTCHA` | MTCaptcha |
| `TEXT_CAPTCHA` | Distorted text/number images with an input field |
| `OTHER` | Unrecognized CAPTCHA types |

## Detect CAPTCHA failures

### Using error code mapping

[Use `error_code_mapping`](/going-to-production/error-handling#step-3-use-error_code_mapping) to detect when a CAPTCHA blocks your automation. This gives you a consistent error code instead of parsing free-text failure messages.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
result = await client.run_task(
    prompt="Submit the application form. COMPLETE when you see confirmation.",
    url="https://example.com/apply",
    error_code_mapping={
        "cant_solve_captcha": "return this error if captcha isn't solved after multiple retries",
    },
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const result = await client.runTask({
  body: {
    prompt: "Submit the application form. COMPLETE when you see confirmation.",
    url: "https://example.com/apply",
    error_code_mapping: {
      cant_solve_captcha: "return this error if captcha isn't solved after multiple retries",
    },
  },
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/run/tasks" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SKYVERN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Submit the application form. COMPLETE when you see confirmation.",
    "url": "https://example.com/apply",
    "error_code_mapping": {
      "cant_solve_captcha": "return this error if captcha isn't solved after multiple retries"
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

When a CAPTCHA blocks the run, the response includes `output.error = "cant_solve_captcha"` — you can branch your logic on this code.

### Using Human Interaction block

For workflows, use the **Human Interaction** block to notify a human when a CAPTCHA needs manual solving.

The block pauses the workflow and sends an email. The recipient can then use the **Take Control** button in Skyvern Cloud to solve the CAPTCHA manually. Once solved, they reply to the email with the positive descriptor (e.g., "Continue") to resume the workflow.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
import asyncio
from skyvern import Skyvern

async def main():
    client = Skyvern(api_key=os.getenv("SKYVERN_API_KEY"))

    workflow = await client.create_workflow(
        json_definition={

## Handle CAPTCHA failures

Use the **Take Control** button in the Cloud UI to manually solve CAPTCHAs that the agent can't handle.

<img src="/images/take-control.png" />

While watching a live run, click **Take Control** to pause the agent and operate the browser yourself. You can click, type, and solve the CAPTCHA directly. Release control when you're done and the agent resumes from where you left off.

<Note>
To watch a live run, open the run in the Cloud UI. See [Running from the Cloud UI](/getting-started/quickstart#from-the-cloud-ui) for details.
</Note>

This works both for ad-hoc runs you're monitoring and for workflows that pause via the Human Interaction block.

---

## Built-in bot detection avoidance

Skyvern automatically configures the browser to reduce bot detection triggers. These protections apply to every run — no configuration needed.

- **`AutomationControlled` disabled** — Removes the Blink feature flag that marks the browser as automated
- **`navigator.webdriver` hidden** — The `enable-automation` flag is suppressed so JavaScript detection scripts don't see a webdriver
- **Viewport and user agent** — Set to match real consumer browsers
- **Locale and timezone** — Automatically matched to the proxy location (see [Proxy & Geolocation](/going-to-production/proxy-geolocation))

---

## Reducing detection risk

Beyond fingerprinting, how you structure your automation affects detection:

- **Use residential proxies for sensitive sites** — Datacenter IPs are the most common bot signal. Residential proxies route through real ISP addresses. Set `proxy_location="RESIDENTIAL"` or use `RESIDENTIAL_ISP` for static IPs.
- **Reuse browser sessions for multi-step flows** — Creating a fresh browser for every step looks suspicious. A persistent session maintains cookies, cache, and history. See [Browser Sessions](/optimization/browser-sessions).
- **Use browser profiles for repeat visits** — Profiles save browser state from a previous session. The site sees a known browser with familiar cookies instead of a blank slate. See [Browser Profiles](/optimization/browser-profiles).
- **Add wait blocks between rapid actions** — Instant actions can trigger behavioral detection. A short pause between steps looks more human.

### If you get blocked

- **Increase `max_steps`** — Some bot challenges (like Cloudflare) loop through multiple verification pages. More steps give the solver more attempts.
- **Switch to a residential proxy** — `RESIDENTIAL_ISP` provides a static IP that services are more likely to trust.
- **Use a browser profile that previously passed** — If a profile has already cleared a Cloudflare challenge on a domain, it's more likely to pass again.
- **Load Chrome extensions** — Extensions can add additional stealth capabilities. Set `EXTENSIONS` and `EXTENSIONS_BASE_PATH` in your environment.

---

## Self-hosted deployments

Automatic CAPTCHA solving is not available for self-hosted deployments.

Instead, when a CAPTCHA is detected, the agent pauses for 30 seconds to allow manual intervention — solve it in the browser window yourself, then the agent continues automatically.
