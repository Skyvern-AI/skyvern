Skyvern's workflow consists of a sequence of workflow blocks. A workflow block usually represents a specific unit of task you can perform. We have [a library of blocks](/workflows/workflow-blocks-details) that you can use to build your workflow.

You can build and manage workflows using the [Skyvern Workflow UI](https://app.skyvern.com/workflows).

You can also manage them via [Workflow APIs](/api-reference/api-reference/workflows/get-workflows) if you want to do it programmatically.

### Create and edit workflows
#### Add a workflow block

Click "+" button to add a new block. There's a library of blocks that you can use to build your workflow. See details of how to use each block [here](/workflows/workflow-blocks-details).

<Warning>The workflow is not auto saved. Don't forget to click the "Save" button on the top after editing your workflow.</Warning>

#### Delete a workflow block

Click the ellipsis ("...") button and "Delete Block" on the top right corner of the block to delete it.

### Export, Import & Delete Workflows
These actions can be done on [Skyvern's Workflows](https://app.skyvern.com/workflows) page.

You can export and save a workflow definition in the format of a YAML or JSON file. You can also import a workflow definition from a YAML or JSON file.

If you want the workflow to be deleted from your workflow list, use the "Delete Workflow" button.

### Workflow Version Control
Version control is a common feature in any workflow builder. This feature is not supported in the UI yet but is coming soon!

To achieve version control today, you can clone a workflow and give the cloned workflow a new name to manage different versions.

## Managing Credentials and Sensitive Information
This is something the Skyvern team will need to set you up with today. If you're interested, please [book a call with Suchintan](https://meetings.hubspot.com/skyvern/demo)


## Common concepts
### `continue_on_failure`

`continue_on_failure` flag indicates whether a failed block execution should block subsequent blocks or not

### `error_code_mapping`

Maps errors to specific error codes so you can have deterministic outputs

### `persist_browser_session`

The `persist_browser_session` flag indicates whether the browser session should be retained between different workflow runs. When enabled, it uses the same `user_data_dir` for each run and updates it at the end of each run. This is useful for maintaining the browser state, such as login sessions and cookies, across multiple runs of the same workflow, leading to more efficient and seamless execution.

> **Note:** This flag is set at the workflow level, not the block level, meaning it applies to the entire workflow's session persistence rather than individual blocks.

### `output_parameter_key` (autogenerated)

Specifies the output parameter of a specific block so it can be re-used in a subsequent block

Its format is always: `{label}_output`

ie the output parameter for a block like this (which can be referenced in subsequent blocks) would be: `login_output` 
```
- block_type: task
      label: login
      parameter_keys:
        - credentials
      url: website_url
      navigation_goal: >-
        If you're not on the login page, navigate to login page and login using
        the credentials given. First, take actions on promotional popups or cookie prompts that could prevent taking other action on the web page. If you fail to login to find the login page or can't login after several trials, terminate. If login is
        completed, you're successful. 
      data_extraction_goal: >-
        Extract anything for the sake of this demo
      error_code_mapping:
        stuck_with_popups: terminate and return this error if you can't close popups after several tries and can't take the necessary actions on the website because there is a blocking popup on the page
        failed_to_login: terminate and return this error if you fail logging in to the page
```
