Click your avatar at the bottom of the sidebar to open the **Account** page. It has two tabs: **Profile** and **Security**.

## Security

The **Security** tab is where you manage your password and review active sessions.

Under **Set password**, enter your new password and confirm it. A green checkmark appears when the password meets requirements and both fields match. Check **Sign out of all other devices** if you want to invalidate existing sessions — recommended if you suspect unauthorized access.

Click **Save** to apply.

**Active devices** lists every device currently signed into your account, showing the browser, IP address, and last access time. Use this to verify that all sessions are yours.

<Note>
If you signed up with Google or another SSO provider, password management is handled by the external provider and this section may not appear.
