Every run has a detail page showing what the AI saw, what it decided, what it extracted, and whether anything went wrong. Click any run in [Run History](/cloud/viewing-results/run-history) to get here.

## The header

The top of the page shows the workflow title, a color-coded status badge, and the run ID. Three buttons on the right:

- **API & Webhooks** — the exact API request that would reproduce this run, including endpoint, headers, and payload
- **Edit** — jump to the workflow editor
- **Rerun** — start a new run pre-filled with the same parameters (appears after the run finishes)

While a run is in progress, a **Cancel** button appears instead of Rerun.

## Extracted information

On success, the **Extracted Information** section appears above the tabs — the structured data you asked for, displayed as JSON.

The output includes a `summary` (natural language description of what was accomplished), `extracted_information` (structured data matching your schema), and a `failure_reason` field that's `null` on success. On failure, a **Failure Reason** section appears instead with error details in a red box.

## The five tabs

### Overview

The left panel shows the browser state (live stream while running, screenshots after completion). The right panel shows the AI's reasoning timeline.

The timeline is a chronological feed of three card types:

| Card | What it shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Thought** | The AI's internal reasoning — what it sees, what it plans to do, and why. Tagged with "Decision." |
| **Block** | When a workflow block starts or finishes (e.g., "Extraction"). Green checkmark = success. |
| **Action** | Individual browser operations (e.g., "#1 Extract Data") with a description of what was done. |

Click any timeline item to see its corresponding screenshot in the left panel. The **Actions** and **Steps** counters at the top give you a quick sense of how much work the run involved.

<Tip>
When a run produces wrong results, start with the Thought cards. Read the AI's reasoning to find where it went off track — a misidentified element, or a premature "goal met" conclusion.
</Tip>

### Output

All output data in one place. **Workflow Run Outputs** shows the complete JSON with line numbers and syntax highlighting. **Workflow Run Downloaded Files** lists any files the workflow downloaded — click to download directly.

### Parameters

The configuration that produced this run: workflow input parameters (key-value pairs), webhook URL, proxy location, and HTTP headers. Use this to verify a run received the right inputs or to recreate a past result.

When you select a block in the Overview timeline, this tab also shows that block's configuration — prompt, URL, schema, and other settings.

### Recording

Full video replay of the browser session. Every run is recorded automatically. Scrub through to see exactly what appeared on screen at any point.

<Note>
If the run was canceled before the browser started, you'll see a "No recording available" message.
</Note>

### Code

Python code generated from the run. This tab appears when code generation is enabled (the default engine). Copy the code to run outside Skyvern, or click **Copy & Explain** for an AI-generated explanation.

If the workflow uses cached code, a **Cache Key selector** lets you switch between versions.

## Debugging failed runs

Work through these in order:

1. **Read the Failure Reason** at the top. It usually tells you what happened — timeout, navigation error, or missing element.
2. **Walk the Thought cards** in the Overview timeline. Find the point where the AI made an incorrect assumption about page state.
3. **Check the Parameters tab** to confirm inputs were correct. A wrong URL or missing parameter is a common cause.
4. **Watch the Recording** to see what actually happened. Popups, CAPTCHAs, and unexpected page layouts are often obvious on video.

## Run statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `created` | Initialized, waiting to be queued |
| `queued` | Waiting for an available browser slot |
| `running` | Actively executing — browser stream is live |
| `completed` | Finished successfully |
| `failed` | Stopped due to an error |
| `terminated` | Stopped by the system (e.g., resource limits) |
| `canceled` | Stopped by you via the Cancel button |
| `timed_out` | Exceeded the configured time limit |

While a run is in progress, the status badge updates automatically, the Overview tab shows a live browser stream, and the timeline grows as new items complete.
