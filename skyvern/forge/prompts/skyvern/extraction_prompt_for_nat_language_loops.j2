Analyze the current webpage and extract information based on this request: {{ natural_language_prompt }}

You need to identify what values should be iterated over (loop_values).

For example:
- If the request is "go to each product page", extract product URLs and titles as objects with url and title fields
- If the request is "process each article", extract article links and titles as objects with url and title fields
- If the request is "download each file", extract file download links and names as objects with url and title fields

Return the results in the specified schema format with loop_values containing an array of objects, where each object has at least a url field and optionally a title field.
