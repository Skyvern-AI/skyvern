You are evaluating conditional branches for a workflow. Return the results to tell me whether each natural language criterion is satisfied.

Criteria (order matters; align outputs to these indices):
{% for criterion in branch_criteria -%}
- {{ criterion.index }}: {{ criterion.expression }}
{% endfor %}

Respond with JSON exactly in this shape:
{
  "branch_results": [true | false per criterion, in order]
}
