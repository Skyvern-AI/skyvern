Extract all visible text from this image.

MAKE SURE YOU OUTPUT VALID JSON. No text before or after JSON, no trailing commas, no comments, no unnecessary quotes.

Reply in JSON format with the following keys:
{
    "extracted_text": str // All text extracted from the image
}

TEXT EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- Preserve reading order (top to bottom, left to right)
- For tables: format as rows separated by newlines, columns separated by " | "
- For multi-column layouts: extract each column separately, separated by blank lines
- For forms: format as "Label: Value" on each line
- Preserve line breaks where they appear meaningful (paragraphs, list items)
- Include all visible text: headers, body text, labels, captions, watermarks
- For handwritten text: do your best to transcribe, use [illegible] for unclear parts

If no text is visible in the image, return an empty string for extracted_text.
