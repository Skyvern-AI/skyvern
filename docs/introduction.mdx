[Skyvern](https://www.skyvern.com) automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual workflows, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions.

# Why Skyvern?

Traditional approaches to browser automations required writing custom scripts for websites, often relying on DOM parsing and XPath-based interactions which would break whenever the website layouts changed.

Instead of only relying on code-defined XPath interactions, Skyvern relies on prompts in addition to computer vision and LLMs to the mix to parse items in the viewport in real-time, create a plan for interaction and interact with them.

This approach gives us a few advantages:

1. Skyvern can operate on websites it‚Äôs never seen before, as it‚Äôs able to map visual elements to actions necessary to complete a workflow, without any customized code
1. Skyvern is resistant to website layout changes, as there are no pre-determined XPaths or other selectors our system is looking for while trying to navigate
1. Skyvern is able to take a single workflow and apply it to a large number of websites, as it‚Äôs able to reason through the interactions necessary to complete the workflow
1. Skyvern leverages LLMs to reason through interactions to ensure we can cover complex situations. Examples include:
    1. If you wanted to get an auto insurance quote from Geico, the answer to a common question ‚ÄúWere you eligible to drive at 18?‚Äù could be inferred from the driver receiving their license at age 16
    1. If you were doing competitor analysis, it‚Äôs understanding that an Arnold Palmer 22 oz can at 7/11 is almost definitely the same product as a 23 oz can at Gopuff (even though the sizes are slightly different, which could be a rounding error!)

# How it works
Skyvern was inspired by the Task-Driven autonomous agent design popularized by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) -- with one major bonus: we give Skyvern the ability to interact with websites using browser automation libraries like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
