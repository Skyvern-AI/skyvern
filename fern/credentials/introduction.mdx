Need to give Skyvern access to your credentials? Usernames and passwords, 2FA, credit cards for payments, etc. Skyvern's credential management provides a secure way to manage and use credentials. Agents can then use them without exposing those credentials to LLMs.

### 2FA Support (TOTP)

Many websites require entering a TOTP (2FA/MFA/Verification) code during login. Skyvern has TOTP (2FA/MFA/Verification Code) support natively.

**Supported authentication methods**:
- Phone verification code
- Email verification code
- Authenticator app
- Confirmation link sent to email. Click the link and create an account
- One time login link sent to email. Click and login

If you have any questions about how to set these up, please contact [Skyvern Support](mailto:support@skyvern.com).

## Credit Card Management

Skyvern can manage your credit cards and use them to complete tasks.

**Supported credit card types**:
- Visa
- Mastercard

## Password Manager Integrations

If you have your own password manager, Skyvern can integrate with it. Skyvern can read the credentials on the fly to complete tasks while keeping your credentials secure. Skyvern never stores your credentials or sends them to any third parties (including LLMs).

**Supported password manager types**:
- Bitwarden
- 1Password Integration (Private beta)

**Coming Soon**:
- LastPass Integration
- Keeper Integration
- Azure Key Vault Integration

Contact [Skyvern Support](mailto:support@skyvern.com) if you want access to the private beta for these integrations.
