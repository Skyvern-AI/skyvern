## API Response Structure

The API returns a JSON array where each element represents a workflow object. Below is the structure and documentation for each field.

```json
[
  {
    "workflow_id": "string",
    "organization_id": "string",
    "title": "string",
    "workflow_permanent_id": "string",
    "version": "integer",
    "is_saved_task": "boolean",
    "description": "string",
    "proxy_location": "string | null",
    "webhook_callback_url": "string | null",
    "totp_verification_url": "string | null",
    "workflow_definition": {
      "parameters": [
        {
          "parameter_type": "string",
          "key": "string",
          "description": "string | null"
        }
      ],
      "blocks": [
        {
          "label": "string",
          "block_type": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Fields

* **workflow_id** (`string`): 
  * A unique identifier for the workflow. This ID is used to reference the workflow in various operations and tasks.

* **organization_id** (`string`): 
  * The unique identifier of the organization to which the workflow belongs. This is useful for segregating workflows by different organizations.

* **title** (`string`): 
  * The human-readable title of the workflow. It typically describes the primary task or purpose of the workflow.

* **workflow_permanent_id** (`string`): 
  * A permanent and unique identifier for the workflow. Unlike `workflow_id`, this ID remains consistent across different versions of the workflow.

* **version** (`integer`): 
  * Indicates the version number of the workflow. This is incremented with each update or modification to the workflow.

* **is_saved_task** (`boolean`): 
  * A flag indicating whether the workflow is saved as a task for future use (`true`) or not (`false`).

* **description** (`string`): 
  * A brief description of what the workflow does. This may include the primary goal or steps involved in the workflow.

* **proxy_location** (`string | null`): 
  * The location setting for the proxy, if applicable. It could be `RESIDENTIAL`, `DATACENTER`, or `null` if no proxy is used.

* **webhook_callback_url** (`string | null`): 
  * The URL to which callbacks will be sent once the workflow completes or if specific events occur during its execution. This field may be `null` if no webhook is configured.

* **totp_verification_url** (`string | null`): 
  * The URL for TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) verification, if required. This field is `null` if TOTP verification is not necessary for the workflow.

* **workflow_definition** (`object`): 
  * Contains the detailed definition of the workflow, including the parameters and blocks that make up the workflow.

  * **parameters** (`array`): 
    * A list of parameters used by the workflow. Each parameter defines a key-value pair that may include the type of parameter, its key, and an optional description. Parameters help in customizing and controlling the workflow's behavior.

  * **blocks** (`array`): 
    * A series of blocks that represent individual tasks or actions within the workflow. Each block includes a label and type, which define the nature and purpose of the task within the workflow. Blocks can range from simple tasks, like logging in, to more complex sequences of actions.
