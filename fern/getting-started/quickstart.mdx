## Python SDK
<Tip title="Supported Python Versions" icon="fa-brands fa-python">
Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13
</Tip>

### Install Skyvern
```bash
pip install skyvern
```

### Run Task On A Skyvern Service
Get your API key from [Skyvern Cloud](https://app.skyvern.com/settings). Send the task to Skyvern Cloud:
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern
import asyncio

skyvern = Skyvern(api_key="YOUR API KEY")
# OR pass the base_url to use any Skyvern service
# skyvern = Skyvern(base_url="http://localhost:8000", api_key="YOUR API KEY")

asyncio.run(skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today"))
```
More API & SDK information can be found in the [API Reference](/api-reference) section.

### Run Task Locally
You can also run browser tasks locally with Python code, with a little bit of set up:

1. **Configure Skyvern** Run the setup wizard which will guide you through the configuration process. This will generate a `.env` as the configuration settings file.
        ```bash
        skyvern init
        ```

2. **Run Task In Python Code**
        ```python
        from skyvern import Skyvern
        import asyncio
        
        skyvern = Skyvern()        
        
        asyncio.run(skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today"))
	    ```
        A local browser will pop up. Skyvern will start executing the task in the browser and close the browser when the task is done.
