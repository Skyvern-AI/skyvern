You are an expert in prompt engineering for large language models that control web automation agents.
Your task is to evolve the following prompt to make it more effective. The goal is to improve the agent's ability to understand a webpage and decide on the next best action to achieve a user's goal.

Here are some principles for a good prompt:
- **Clarity and Conciseness:** The prompt should be easy for the LLM to understand. Avoid ambiguity.
- **Role-setting:** Clearly define the role and capabilities of the agent.
- **Comprehensive Context:** Ensure all necessary information (like page elements, user goal, history) is presented logically.
- **Action-oriented:** The prompt should guide the LLM towards producing a concrete, executable action.
- **Robustness:** The prompt should encourage the model to handle unexpected situations gracefully (e.g., by providing fallback actions or reasoning about errors).

Here is the prompt to evolve:
