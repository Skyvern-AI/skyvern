The Skyvern Make.com integration lets you connect Skyvern with Make's library of 1,500+ apps.

Use it to trigger browser automation jobs from other tools, or to send Skyvern results into other apps.

## What you'll need

- A Skyvern Cloud API key from [Settings](https://app.skyvern.com/settings)

---

## Available Modules

Modules are steps your scenario performs to interact with Skyvern.

| Module | Use this to |
|--------|-------------|
| Run a Task | Run an automation using the `skyvern-1.0` engine. Best for simple tasks like filling a form or searching for information. |
| Run a Task V2 | Run an automation using the `skyvern-2.0` engine. Best for complex, multi-step goals with dynamic planning. |
| Run a Workflow | Run a pre-built Skyvern workflow with parameters. |
| Get a Task | Retrieve results from a previously run task (v1). |
| Get a Task V2 | Retrieve results from a previously run task (v2). |
| Get a Workflow | Retrieve results from a previously run workflow. |
| List Organizations | Retrieve a list of all organizations in your account. |
| Make an API Call | Execute a custom API request using your authorized credentials. |

## Step 3: Set configuration fields

Configuration varies by module type.

### Run a Task

Both task modules use the same configuration fields. The difference is the underlying engine:

- **Run a Task** uses `skyvern-1.0` — optimized for simple, single-step goals
- **Run a Task V2** uses `skyvern-2.0` — uses dynamic planning for complex, multi-step goals

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| URL | Yes | The starting page for the automation. |
| Navigation Goal | Often | What Skyvern should do on the page. End with "COMPLETE" when done or "TERMINATE" to stop. Omit if only extracting data. |
| Data Extraction Goal | No | What data to extract after navigation completes. Be specific about what to return. |
| Navigation Payload | No | JSON object with input data for forms. Use this to run the same task with different data. |
| Extracted Information Schema | No | JSON schema specifying how extracted data should be formatted. |
| Webhook Callback URL | No | URL to notify when Skyvern finishes executing. |
| Max Steps | No | Limit the number of steps to control costs. |

<Note>
The navigation goal describes what to do *after* loading the URL. Don't include "go to website X" in the navigation goal—use the URL field instead.

### Run a Workflow

First, create your workflow in the [Skyvern UI](https://app.skyvern.com).

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Workflow | Yes | Select the workflow you want to run from the dropdown. |
| Parameters | Depends | Fill in any parameters defined in your workflow. Skip if your workflow uses fixed values. |

### Get a Task / Workflow

Use these modules to retrieve the output of a previous run into your scenario. The run must have already completed.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Task ID | Yes | The ID of the task run. Starts with `tsk_`. |
| Workflow Run ID | Yes | The ID of the workflow run. Starts with `wr_`. |
