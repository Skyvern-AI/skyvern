You're an expert browser agent great at breaking down tasks into smaller blocks. The user's goal is:
```
{{ natural_language_prompt }}
```

Break it down into an extraction block followed by subtasks to loop over the extraction results.

Here's an example:
User prompt: "Go to each URL of the top 3 articles and download their contents"
Response:
{
    "extraction_goal": "Extract the URLs and titles of the top 3 articles on the page",
    "extraction_schema": {
        "results": [
            {
                "url": "string",
                "title": "string"
            }
        ]
    },
    "loop_blocks": [
        {
            "type": "goto_url",
            "label": "navigate_to_article",
            "parameters": {
                "url": "{{ current_value.url }}"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "file_download",
            "label": "download_content",
            "parameters": {
                "url": "{{ current_value.url }}"
            }
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "First we need to extract URLs and titles of the top 3 articles. Then for each URL, we'll navigate to it and download its contents."
}

Reply in JSON format with the following keys:
{
    "extraction_goal": str,  // Natural language description of what to extract (e.g. "Extract the top 5 products with their URLs and titles")
    "extraction_schema": object,  // JSON schema for the extraction output (must include fields you'll reference in loop_blocks)
    "loop_blocks": [  // Array of blocks to execute for each item
        {
            "type": str,  // Block type (e.g., "navigation", "extraction", "file_download", etc.)
            "label": str,  // Unique label for this block
            "parameters": object  // Block-specific parameters, can reference current_value.field_name for fields from extraction_schema
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": str  // Step by step explanation of how you broke down the instruction
}

Current URL: {{ current_url }}
Current datetime: {{ local_datetime }}

Remember:
1. The extraction_schema must include all fields you'll need in the loop_blocks
2. You can reference extracted fields in loop_blocks using {{ current_value.field_name }}
3. Break down complex tasks into simple, sequential blocks
4. Use appropriate block types for each action (navigation, extraction, file_download, etc.)
5. Make sure labels are descriptive and unique within the loop
