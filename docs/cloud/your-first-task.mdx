Let's run a real automation. You'll tell Skyvern to visit a website, extract data, and return it as JSON — then watch the entire thing happen live.

## Step 1: Write your prompt

Open [app.skyvern.com](https://app.skyvern.com) and you'll land on the **Discover** page.

<img src="/images/cloud/skyvern-cloud-discover.png" alt="Discover page with a prompt entered" />

The Discover page has a single input field — type your instructions and include the target URL in the same prompt. For this example, enter:

```
Get the title of the #1 post on the front page for https://news.ycombinator.com
```

That's it. Skyvern parses the URL and figures out how to navigate the page and extract the data.

Below the input, you'll see quick-action chips like "Add a product to cart" and "What's the top post on hackernews" — click any of these to try a pre-filled example instead.

<Tip>
The more specific your prompt, the better. "Get the title of the #1 post" works much better than "get some data." Include the exact fields you want, what success looks like, and any constraints.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Pick an engine and run

Next to your prompt, you'll see an engine selector. Click it to switch engines:

| Engine | When to use it |
|--------|---------------|
| **Skyvern 1.0** | Tasks with a simple, single goal — filling a form, searching for information on Google, reading content from a page |
| **Skyvern 2.0** | The default engine. Handles complex, multi-step tasks and scores state-of-the-art 85.85% on the WebVoyager benchmark |

For this example, the default **Skyvern 2.0** works.

Click the **send button** (arrow icon to the right of the input). Skyvern spins up a cloud browser and starts working.

<Accordion title="Optional: Advanced settings">
Click the **gear icon** next to send to configure additional options before running:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Webhook Callback URL** | Endpoint to receive the extracted data when the run completes |
| **Proxy Location** | Route Skyvern through one of the available proxies |
| **Browser Session ID** | Reuse a persistent browser session to keep login state |
| **Browser Address** | Connect to a specific browser server for the task run |
| **2FA Identifier** | Identifier for a 2FA code to handle two-factor auth automatically |
| **Extra HTTP Headers** | Custom HTTP request headers (dict format) |
| **Generate Script** | Auto-generate reusable scripts from a successful run |
| **Publish Workflow** | Create a workflow alongside this task run |
| **Max Steps Override** | Cap the number of steps the AI can take |
| **Data Schema** | Define structured JSON output format |
| **Max Screenshot Scrolls** | Limit scrolls for post-action screenshots (default: 3) |

These are all optional. The defaults work for most tasks.
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Watch the live browser

This is where it gets interesting. Once the task starts, you'll see the run detail page with a live view of the browser:

<img src="/images/cloud/discover-prompt-in-process.png" alt="Run detail page showing a live browser navigating Hacker News" />

On the left, a **live browser view**. You'll see pages load, elements highlight, and actions fire.

On the right, the **agent log**. A running stream of the AI's Thoughts, Decisions, and block executions. If something goes wrong, this is where you'll figure out why.

### Take control at any time

If you see something unexpected or would like to intervene, click **"Take Control"** to drop into the browser session yourself. You can navigate, click, type, whatever.  When you're done, release control and the AI picks up where you left off.

This is useful for CAPTCHAs, unusual login flows, or any situation where you want to guide the AI past a tricky spot.

## Step 4: Review the results

When the task finishes, the status badge flips to **completed** and the extracted data appears at the top of the page.

### Extracted data

The **Extracted Information** block shows your results as structured JSON:

```json
{
  "top_post_title": "Don't rent the cloud, own instead"
}
```

The agent log on the right confirms what happened — you'll see a final Thought summarizing the result and a green **"Run Completed"** notification.

### Tabs

Below the extracted data, five tabs give you different views of the run:

- **Overview** — The default view. Shows extracted data and the agent log with every Thought and Decision.
- **Output** — The raw JSON output from the run.
- **Parameters** — The exact configuration that was submitted (URL, prompt, engine, schema). Useful for reproducing or tweaking the run.
- **Recording** — Full video replay of the browser session, start to finish.
- **Code** — Auto-generated code snippets to reproduce this task via the API or SDK.

## Try something bigger

Now that you've seen the basic flow, here are a few ideas to try next:

- **Fill a form** — Point Skyvern at a contact form and tell it what to enter in each field
- **Compare prices** — Extract product names and prices from an e-commerce page using a data schema
- **Navigate a flow** — Use the Advanced engine to walk through a multi-page checkout or signup process
- **Use an Agent template** — Check the **Agents** section in the sidebar for pre-built automations you can run instantly
