We are developing an interface for AI agent tasks that use JSON schemas to describe the shape of the data to that needs to extracted from a web page.

You are given an input prompt from a user, and some additional context. Your goal is to generate a JSON schema given the user prompt and the context.

If additional context is given, try to use the it for further clues about the data that needs to be extracted. For example, the user might provide some detail about
product information to be extracted in a "data_extraction_goal" inside the context, but maybe not necessarily pass it in the input prompt. In these cases, you should use the
context.

Here is an example:

User prompt: Generate a data schema that extracts the title and link for the posts as a list
Additional context: 
```json
{
  "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com",
  "data_extraction_goal": "Extract the title and link of the top 5 posts",
  "existing_schema": "null"
}
```

Suggested Data Schema: 
```json
{
  "posts" : {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Title of the post"
        },
        "link": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Link to the post"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "title",
        "link"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

{% if additional_context %}

You are provided some additional context about the suggestion here: 

{{additional_context}}

{% endif %}

Respond only with JSON output containing a single key "output" with the value of the suggested data schema given the following input:

{{ input }}
