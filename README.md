[Skyvern](https://www.skyvern.com) automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual workflows on a large number of websites, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="fern/images/geico_shu_recording_cropped.gif"/>
</p>

Traditional approaches to browser automations required writing custom scripts for websites, often relying on DOM parsing and XPath-based interactions which would break whenever the website layouts changed.

Instead of only relying on code-defined XPath interactions, Skyvern relies on Vision LLMs to interact with the websites.

# Quickstart

## Skyvern Cloud
[Skyvern Cloud](https://app.skyvern.com) is a managed cloud version of Skyvern that allows you to run Skyvern without worrying about the infrastructure. It allows you to run multiple Skyvern instances in parallel and comes bundled with anti-bot detection mechanisms, proxy network, and CAPTCHA solvers.

If you'd like to try it out, navigate to [app.skyvern.com](https://app.skyvern.com) and create an account.

## Install & Run
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Supported Python Versions**: Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Install Skyvern

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

### 2. Run Skyvern

```bash
skyvern quickstart
```

### 3. Run task

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```
Skyvern starts running the task in a browser that pops up and closes it when the task is done. You will be able to review the task from http://localhost:8080/history

You can also run a task on Skyvern Cloud:
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(api_key="SKYVERN API KEY")
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```

Or your local Skyvern service from step 2:
```python
# Find your API KEY in .env
skyvern = Skyvern(base_url="http://localhost:8000", api_key="LOCAL SKYVERN API KEY")
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```

Check out more features to use for Skyvern task in our [official doc](https://docs.skyvern.com/running-tasks/run-tasks). Here are a couple of interesting examples:
#### Control your own browser (Chrome)
> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Since [Chrome 136](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port), Chrome refuses any CDP connect to the browser using the default user_data_dir. In order to use your browser data, Skyvern copies your default user_data_dir to `./tmp/user_data_dir` the first time connecting to your local browser. ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. Just With Python Code
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

# The path to your Chrome browser. This example path is for Mac.
browser_path = "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
skyvern = Skyvern(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    browser_path=browser_path,
)
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

2. With Skyvern Service

Add two variables to your .env file:
```bash
# The path to your Chrome browser. This example path is for Mac.
CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
BROWSER_TYPE=cdp-connect
```

Restart Skyvern service `skyvern run all` and run the task through UI or code:
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

#### Run Skyvern with any remote browser
Grab the cdp connection url and pass it to Skyvern

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(cdp_url="your cdp connection url")
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

#### Get consistent output schema from your run
You can do this by adding the `data_extraction_schema` parameter:
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
    data_extraction_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The title of the top post"
            },
            "url": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The URL of the top post"
            },
            "points": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Number of points the post has received"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

### Helpful commands to debug issues

**Launch the Skyvern Server Separately** 

```bash
skyvern run server
```

**Launch the Skyvern UI**

```bash
skyvern run ui
```

**Check status of the Skyvern service**

```bash
skyvern status
```
**Stop the Skyvern service**

```bash
skyvern stop all
```
**Stop the Skyvern UI**

```bash
skyvern stop ui
```

**Stop the Skyvern Server Separately**

```bash
skyvern stop server
```

## Docker Compose setup

1. Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running on your machine
1. Make sure you don't have postgres running locally (Run `docker ps` to check)
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
1. Run `skyvern init llm` to generate a `.env` file. This will be copied into the Docker image.
1. Fill in the LLM provider key on the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml). *If you want to run Skyvern on a remote server, make sure you set the correct server ip for the UI container in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml).*
2. Run the following command via the commandline:
   ```bash
    docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to start using the UI

> **Important:** Only one Postgres container can run on port 5432 at a time. If you switch from the CLI-managed Postgres to Docker Compose, you must first remove the original container:
> ```bash
> docker rm -f postgresql-container
> ```

If you encounter any database related errors while using Docker to run Skyvern, check which Postgres container is running with `docker ps`.


# How it works
Skyvern was inspired by the Task-Driven autonomous agent design popularized by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) -- with one major bonus: we give Skyvern the ability to interact with websites using browser automation libraries like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Skyvern uses a swarm of agents to comprehend a website, and plan and execute its actions:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="fern/images/skyvern_2_0_system_diagram.png" />
  <img src="fern/images/skyvern_2_0_system_diagram.png" />
</picture>

This approach has a few advantages:

1. Skyvern can operate on websites it's never seen before, as it's able to map visual elements to actions necessary to complete a workflow, without any customized code
1. Skyvern is resistant to website layout changes, as there are no pre-determined XPaths or other selectors our system is looking for while trying to navigate
1. Skyvern is able to take a single workflow and apply it to a large number of websites, as it's able to reason through the interactions necessary to complete the workflow
1. Skyvern leverages LLMs to reason through interactions to ensure we can cover complex situations. Examples include:
    1. If you wanted to get an auto insurance quote from Geico, the answer to a common question "Were you eligible to drive at 18?" could be inferred from the driver receiving their license at age 16
    1. If you were doing competitor analysis, it's understanding that an Arnold Palmer 22 oz can at 7/11 is almost definitely the same product as a 23 oz can at Gopuff (even though the sizes are slightly different, which could be a rounding error!)

# Skyvern Features

## Skyvern Tasks
Tasks are the fundamental building block inside Skyvern. Each task is a single request to Skyvern, instructing it to navigate through a website and accomplish a specific goal. 

Tasks require you to specify a `url`, `prompt`, and can optionally include a `data schema` (if you want the output to conform to a specific schema) and `error codes` (if you want Skyvern to stop running in specific situations). 

<p align="center">
  <img src="fern/images/skyvern_2_0_screenshot.png"/>
</p>


## Skyvern Workflows
Workflows are a way to chain multiple tasks together to form a cohesive unit of work. 

For example, if you wanted to download all invoices newer than January 1st, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the invoices page, then filtered down to only show invoices newer than January 1st, extracted a list of all eligible invoices, and iterated through each invoice to download it.

Another example is if you wanted to automate purchasing products from an e-commerce store, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the desired product, then added it to a cart. Second, it would navigate to the cart and validate the cart state. Finally, it would go through the checkout process to purchase the items.

Supported workflow features include:
1. Navigation
1. Action
1. Data Extraction
1. Loops
1. File parsing
1. Uploading files to block storage
1. Sending emails
1. Text Prompts
1. Tasks (general)
1. (Coming soon) Conditionals
1. (Coming soon) Custom Code Block

<p align="center">
  <img src="fern/images/invoice_downloading_workflow_example.png"/>
</p>

## Livestreaming
Skyvern allows you to livestream the viewport of the browser to your local machine so that you can see exactly what Skyvern is doing on the web. This is useful for debugging and understanding how Skyvern is interacting with a website, and intervening when necessary

## Form Filling
Skyvern is natively capable of filling out form inputs on websites. Passing in information via the `navigation_goal` will allow Skyvern to comprehend the information and fill out the form accordingly.

## Data Extraction
Skyvern is also capable of extracting data from a website.

You can also specify a `data_extraction_schema` directly within the main prompt to tell Skyvern exactly what data you'd like to extract from the website, in jsonc format. Skyvern's output will be structured in accordance to the supplied schema.

## File Downloading
Skyvern is also capable of downloading files from a website. All downloaded files are automatically uploaded to block storage (if configured), and you can access them via the UI.

## Authentication
Skyvern supports a number of different authentication methods to make it easier to automate tasks behind a login. If you'd like to try it out, please reach out to us [via email](mailto:founders@skyvern.com) or [discord](https://discord.gg/fG2XXEuQX3).
