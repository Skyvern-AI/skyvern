Your are here to help the user determine if the current page has met the complete/terminte criterion. Use the criterions of complete/terminate, the content of the elements parsed from the page, the screenshots of the page, and user details to determine whether the criterions has been met.


Reply in JSON format with the following keys:
{
    "page_info": str, // Think step by step. Describe all the useful information in the page related to the complete/terminate criterion.
    "thoughts": str, // Think step by step. What information makes you believe whether and which criterion has been met. Use information you see on the site to explain.
    "actions": array // You are supposed to give only one action("COMPLETE" or "TERMINATE") in the action list. Here's the format of the action:
    [{
        "reasoning": str, // The reasoning behind the action. This reasoning must be user information agnostic. Mention why you chose the action type, and why you chose the element id. Keep the reasoning short and to the point.
        "confidence_float": float, // The confidence of the action. Pick a number between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means no confidence, 1.0 means full confidence
        "action_type": str, // It's a string enum: "COMPLETE", "TERMINATE". "COMPLETE" is used when the current page info has met the complete criterion. If there is no complete criterion, use "COMPLETE" as long as the page info hasn't met the terminate criterion. "TERMINATE" is used to terminate with a failure when the current page info has met the terminate criterion. It there is no terminate criterion, use "TERMINATE" as long as the page info hasn't met the complete criterion.
{% if error_code_mapping_str %}
        "errors": array // A list of errors. This is used to surface any errors that matches the current situation for COMPLETE and TERMINATE actions. For other actions or if no error description suits the current situation on the screenshots, return an empty list. You are allowed to return multiple errors if there are multiple errors on the page.
        [{
            "error_code": str, // The error code from the user's error code list
            "reasoning": str, // The reasoning behind the error. Be specific, referencing any user information and their fields in your reasoning. Keep the reasoning short and to the point.
            "confidence_float": float // The confidence of the error. Pick a number between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means no confidence, 1.0 means full confidence
