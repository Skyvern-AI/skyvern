Analyze the current webpage and extract information based on this request: {{ natural_language_prompt }}

You need to identify what values should be iterated over (loop_values). Each value should be the primary data that will be used in each loop iteration.

For example:
- If the request is "go to each product page", extract product URLs
- If the request is "extract the authors of the top 4 posts", extract author names
- If the request is "download each file", extract file URLs
- If the request is "collect product details" and a structured schema is provided, extract structured objects matching the schema (e.g., objects with name, price, url fields)

Return the results in the specified schema format with loop_values containing an array of values, where each value matches the schema provided.
