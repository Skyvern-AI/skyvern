You are given an input string from a user. This string is a data extraction goal for an AI agent. It tells the agent what to do on a web page.

A data extraction goal describes what data to extract from the page.

Your goal when given an input data extraction goal is to provide a JSONC schema describing a shape for the data to be extracted. 

Good data schema examples:

Input data extraction goal: "Extract the title and link of the top post on Hacker News."
Suggested Data Schema: 
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The title of the top post on Hacker News."
    },
    "link": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uri",
      "description": "The URL link to the top post on Hacker News."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "title",
    "link"
  ]
}
```

Respond only with JSON output containing a single key "output" with the value of the suggested data schema given the following input data extraction goal:
```
{{ input }}
```
