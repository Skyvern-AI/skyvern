Every API call to Skyvern requires an API key. The key identifies your organization and determines billing.

## Finding your API key

Open **Settings** in the sidebar. Your API key is shown in a masked field. Click the **eye icon** to reveal the full value, or the **copy icon** to copy it to your clipboard.

<Warning>
Treat your API key like a password. Anyone with this key can create runs, read results, and manage workflows on behalf of your organization.
</Warning>

## Using your key

Every Skyvern API request requires the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/runs" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "url": "https://example.com", "goal": "Extract the pricing table" }'
```

With the Python SDK:

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

client = Skyvern(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

<Tip>
Store the key in an environment variable (`SKYVERN_API_KEY`) rather than hardcoding it. In production, use your platform's secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.).
