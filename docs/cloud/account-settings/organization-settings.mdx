Everything in Skyvern — workflows, credentials, runs, API keys — belongs to an **organization**. One is created automatically when you sign up.

## Organization details

Open **Settings** in the sidebar. The Settings page shows your organization name and current plan. The organization name appears throughout the UI and in API responses.

To rename your organization, update the **Organization Name** field and click **Save**.

## Team members

Plans that support multiple users (Pro and Enterprise) show a **Members** section below the organization details.

### Inviting members

Click **Invite Member**, enter their email address, and send the invitation. They'll receive an email with a link to join your organization. Once they accept, they appear in the members list with full access to workflows, runs, credentials, and API keys.

### Removing members

Click the **remove icon** next to a member's name to revoke their access. They lose access to all organization resources immediately.

<Warning>
When removing a team member, also review your [API keys](/cloud/account-settings/api-keys) — they may have copied keys that remain active.
</Warning>

<Note>
Role-based access control (restricting what individual members can do) is available on **Enterprise** plans. On other plans, all members have full access to the organization's resources.
