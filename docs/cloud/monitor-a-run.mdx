When you run a task from the [Discover page](/cloud/run-a-task), you're taken to the live execution screen where you can watch the browser in real time.

## The execution screen

The execution view has three panels:

| Panel | What it shows |
|-------|---------------|
| **Left: Task configuration** | The block being executed, its URL, and prompt. A status badge shows the current state. |
| **Center: Live browser** | Real-time view of the browser. You see pages load, forms fill, and buttons click. |
| **Right: Agent logs** | Real-time LLM reasoning and action decisions. Shows why the AI made each choice. |

## When the live view is available

The live browser stream is active while the task is still in progress:

| Status | Live view |
|--------|-----------|
| `created` | Waiting to start |
| `queued` | Waiting for a browser |
| `running` | **Active**: the browser is navigating |
| `paused` | Waiting for human interaction |
| `completed` | Stream closed. View the recording instead. |
| `failed` | Stream closed. View the recording instead. |
| `terminated` | Stream closed |
| `timed_out` | Stream closed |
| `canceled` | Stream closed |

Once a task reaches a final state, the live stream closes. Open the run from **Runs** in the sidebar to access the full recording, screenshots, and action history.

## Taking control of the browser

The **Take Control** button lets you interact directly with the browser. This is useful when:
- A CAPTCHA appears that the AI can't solve
- The site has an unusual login flow
- You need to navigate past an unexpected popup

Click **Take Control** to start interacting. Your mouse and keyboard input goes directly to the browser. Click **Stop Controlling** to hand control back to the AI.

<Warning>
Taking control pauses the AI agent. Remember to release control so the agent can resume.
</Warning>

## Stopping a running task

You can cancel a task at any time while it's running or queued. Click the **Cancel** button in the task header. A confirmation dialog appears before the task is stopped. The task transitions to `canceled` and any configured webhook fires with the canceled status.

## Reviewing results

Once a task finishes, open it from **Runs** to see the full results.

### Actions tab

Step-by-step breakdown of every action the AI took. Each entry shows:

- **Action type**: Click, Type, Scroll, Select, etc.
- **Success or failure** indicator
- **AI reasoning**: Why the agent chose this action
- **Input details**: For type actions, the text that was entered

### Recording tab

Full video replay of the browser session. Every task is recorded automatically.

### Parameters tab

The configuration you submitted: URL, prompt, engine, proxy location, webhook URL, data schema, and other settings.

### Diagnostics tab

Debug information for troubleshooting:
- **LLM prompts**: The exact prompts sent to the AI model
- **Element trees**: The DOM structure the AI analyzed
- **Annotated screenshots**: Screenshots with element labels the AI used for decisions
