Skyvern's workflow consists of a sequence of workflow blocks. A workflow block usually represents a specific task you can perform.

Building blocks supported today:
- NavigationBlock: Skyvern navigates through the websites to take actions.
- ActionBlock: With a given prompt, Skyvern only takes a single action.
- ExtractBlock: Extract information from the website. You can define the data extraction schema with this block. No other actions will be taken.
- LoginBlock: A built-in block to help log into a website integrated with [Skyvern Credentials](/credentials/introduction).
- ValidationBlock: Like having an assertion in a test, this block validates the state of the workflow. It terminates the workflow if the validation fails. 
- TaskBlock: Skyvern navigates through the websites to take actions and/or extract information.
- ForLoopBlock: Support for loop in the workflow.
- UrlBlock: Go to a given URL.
- CodeBlock: Code block allows you to write any custom python and playwright script to interact with the browser. For Skyvern Cloud, it's an invite only feature.
- TextPromptBlock: A text only prompt block.
- SendEmailBlock: Send an email.
- FileDownloadBlock: Given a goal, Skyvern downloads a file from the website.
- FileParserBlock: Given a file url, Skyvern downloads the file from the url, and returns the parsed content as the output of the block. Supports CSV, Excel, and PDF file formats.
- PDFParserBlock: Given a pdf url, Skyvern downloads the PDF file from the url and returns the parsed content as the output of the block.
- FileUploadBlock: Upload all the downloaded files to a desired destination. Currently only AWS S3 is supported. Please contact support@skyvern.com if you need more integrations.
- WaitBlock: Wait for a given amount of time.
- NavigationV2Block (TaskV2Block): The advanced version of the NavigationBlock, powered by the Skyvern 2.0 engine. Designed for complicated goals.
