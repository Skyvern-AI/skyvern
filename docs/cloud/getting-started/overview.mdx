Skyvern Cloud ([app.skyvern.com](https://app.skyvern.com)) lets you automate any website from your browser. Describe what you want in plain English, watch an AI-powered browser do it live, and get structured results back. No code required.

## The dashboard

Sign in and you'll land on the **Discover** page, the starting point for running automations.

The left sidebar is your navigation hub. Here's what each section does:

### Build

Where you create and monitor automations.

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Discover** | Run one-off tasks. Type your instructions and target URL into a single prompt, pick an engine, and hit send. |
| **Workflows** | Build multi-step automations with the visual workflow editor. Add loops, conditionals, and data passing between steps. |
| **Runs** | Execution history for every task and workflow. Filter by status, drill into any run to see actions, recordings, and extracted data. |
| **Browsers** | Active browser sessions. Useful for persistent sessions that keep login state across tasks. |

### Agents

Ready-made automation templates. Each agent is preconfigured with a prompt, target URL, and settings. Pick one to see it work or use it as a starting point for your own task.

### General

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Billing** | Usage, remaining credits, and plan management. |
| **Credentials** | Store website logins securely. Skyvern uses these to authenticate automatically when it encounters a login page. |
| **Settings** | API key, account preferences, and organization management. |

## How it works

Every automation in Skyvern Cloud follows the same pattern:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe your task">
    Type what you want into the prompt bar. Include the target URL and your instructions in one go. Something like "Get the top post from https://news.ycombinator.com" or "Fill out the contact form at https://example.com/contact with my details."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch it happen">
    A cloud browser opens and you see it navigate in real time. Pages load, elements highlight, actions fire. An agent log streams the AI's reasoning — what it sees on the page, what it plans to do, and why — so you can follow along. If the AI gets stuck, hit **Take Control** to jump in and help.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your results">
    Extracted data appears as structured JSON on the run detail page. Every run also includes an output view, full recording, the parameters you submitted, and auto-generated code to reproduce the task via API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it. The next guide walks you through this flow with a real example.
