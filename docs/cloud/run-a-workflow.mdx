Once you've built and saved a workflow, you can run it from the editor or the workflows list. Each run creates an independent execution with its own status, logs, and output.

## Starting a run

Two ways to start:

1. **From the editor**: Click the **Run** button (play icon) in the header bar. The editor saves your workflow first.
2. **From the workflows list**: Click the **play icon** on the workflow's row.

Both take you to the parameters page where you fill in runtime values before the run starts.


## Filling in parameters

The parameters page shows all [workflow parameters](/cloud/add-parameters) defined in the editor. Fill in a value for each one, or leave them at their defaults. Parameters without defaults must be filled in before running.


## Run settings

Below the parameters, you can configure settings for this specific run:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Proxy Location** | Route browser traffic through a proxy in a specific country. Default: US Residential. |
| **Webhook Callback URL** | URL that receives a POST request when the run completes |
| **Max Screenshot Scrolls** | Override screenshot scroll depth for this run |
| **Extra HTTP Headers** | Custom headers included in all browser requests (JSON) |
| **CDP Address** | Connect to your own browser for local development |

---

## Monitoring a run

After clicking **Run**, you're taken to the live execution view, the same interface described in [Watching Live Execution](/cloud/monitor-a-run).

For workflows, the left panel also shows a **block timeline**: a list of all blocks in the workflow. Completed blocks show a checkmark. The currently executing block is highlighted.

## Run statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `created` | Run initialized |
| `queued` | Waiting for an available browser |
| `running` | Blocks are executing |
| `completed` | All blocks finished successfully |
| `failed` | A block failed and the workflow stopped |
| `canceled` | You canceled the run |
| `timed_out` | The run exceeded its time limit |
| `terminated` | The run was terminated by the system |

## Viewing results

After a run completes, open it from **Runs** in the sidebar. The run detail page shows:

- **Block-by-block results**: Each block's output, status, and execution time
- **Recording**: Full video replay of the browser session
- **Parameters**: The values you submitted for this run

See [Reviewing results](/cloud/monitor-a-run#reviewing-results) for details on the Actions, Recording, Parameters, and Diagnostics tabs.

---

## Canceling a run

Click the **Cancel** button during execution. A confirmation dialog appears. The run moves to `canceled` status and any configured webhook fires.

---

## Run history

Access past runs from two places:

1. **Runs** in the left sidebar: shows all runs across all workflows
2. **History** button (clock icon) in the workflow editor: shows runs for this specific workflow
