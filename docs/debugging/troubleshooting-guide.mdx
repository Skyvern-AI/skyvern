When a run fails or produces unexpected results, this guide helps you identify the cause and fix it.

## Quick debugging checklist

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/debugging-checklist.png" alt="Skyvern Debugging Checklist" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check run status">
    Call `get_run(run_id)` and check `status` and `failure_reason`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the failed step">
    Call `get_run_timeline(run_id)` to see which block failed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect artifacts">
    Check `screenshot_final` to see where it stopped, `recording` to watch what happened
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine the fix">
    Adjust prompt, parameters, or file a bug based on what you find
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Key artifacts to check:**
- `screenshot_final` — Final page state
- `recording` — Video of what happened
- `llm_response_parsed` — What the AI decided to do
- `visible_elements_tree` — What elements were detected
- `har` — Network requests if something failed to load

## Step 1: Check the run

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from skyvern import Skyvern

client = Skyvern(api_key=os.getenv("SKYVERN_API_KEY"))

run = await client.get_run(run_id)

print(f"Status: {run.status}")
print(f"Failure reason: {run.failure_reason}")
print(f"Step count: {run.step_count}")
print(f"Output: {run.output}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { SkyvernClient } from "@skyvern/client";

const client = new SkyvernClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SKYVERN_API_KEY,
});

const run = await client.getRun(runId);

console.log(`Status: ${run.status}`);
console.log(`Failure reason: ${run.failure_reason}`);
console.log(`Step count: ${run.step_count}`);
console.log(`Output: ${JSON.stringify(run.output)}`);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SKYVERN_API_KEY" \
  | jq '{status, failure_reason, step_count, output}'
```
</CodeGroup>

| Status | What it means | Likely cause |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| `completed` | Run finished, but output may be wrong | Prompt interpretation issue |
| `failed` | System error | Browser crash, network failure |
| `terminated` | AI gave up | Login blocked, CAPTCHA, page unavailable |
| `timed_out` | Exceeded `max_steps` | Task too complex, or AI got stuck |
| `canceled` | Manually stopped | — |

---

## Step 2: Read the step timeline

The timeline shows each block and action in execution order.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
timeline = await client.get_run_timeline(run_id)

for item in timeline:
    if item.type == "block":
        block = item.block
        print(f"Block: {block.label}")
        print(f"  Status: {block.status}")
        print(f"  Duration: {block.duration}s")
        if block.failure_reason:
            print(f"  Failure: {block.failure_reason}")
        for action in block.actions:
            print(f"  Action: {action.action_type} -> {action.status}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const timeline = await client.getRunTimeline(runId);

for (const item of timeline) {
  if (item.type === "block") {
    const block = item.block;
    console.log(`Block: ${block.label}`);
    console.log(`  Status: ${block.status}`);
    console.log(`  Duration: ${block.duration}s`);
    if (block.failure_reason) {
      console.log(`  Failure: ${block.failure_reason}`);
    }
    for (const action of block.actions || []) {
      console.log(`  Action: ${action.action_type} -> ${action.status}`);
    }
  }
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID/timeline" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SKYVERN_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Step 3: Inspect artifacts

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
artifacts = await client.get_run_artifacts(
    run_id,
    artifact_type=["screenshot_final", "llm_response_parsed", "skyvern_log"]
)

for a in artifacts:
    print(f"{a.artifact_type}: {a.signed_url}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const artifacts = await client.getRunArtifacts(runId, {
  artifact_type: ["screenshot_final", "llm_response_parsed", "skyvern_log"]
});

for (const a of artifacts) {
  console.log(`${a.artifact_type}: ${a.signed_url}`);
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID/artifacts?artifact_type=screenshot_final&artifact_type=llm_response_parsed&artifact_type=skyvern_log" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SKYVERN_API_KEY" \
  | jq '.[] | "\(.artifact_type): \(.signed_url)"'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Common issues and fixes

### Run Status Issues

<Accordion title="Run completed but output is wrong">
**Symptom:** Status is `completed`, but the extracted data is incorrect or incomplete.

**Check:** `screenshot_final` (right page?) and `llm_response_parsed` (right elements?)

**Fix:**
- Add specific descriptions in your schema: `"description": "The price in USD, without currency symbol"`
- Add visual hints: "The price is displayed in bold below the product title"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Run timed out">
**Symptom:** Status is `timed_out`.

**Check:** `recording` (stuck in a loop?) and `step_count` (how many steps?)

**Fix:**
- Increase `max_steps` if the task genuinely needs more steps
- Add explicit completion criteria: "COMPLETE when you see 'Order confirmed'"
- Break complex tasks into multiple workflow blocks
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Run stuck in queued state">
**Symptom:** Run stays in `queued` status and never starts.

**Likely causes:** Concurrency limit hit, sequential run lock, or high platform load.

**Fix:**
- Wait for other runs to complete
- Check your plan's concurrency limits in Settings
- If using "Run Sequentially" with credentials, ensure prior runs finish
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="504 Gateway Timeout on browser session">
**Symptom:** Getting `504 Gateway Timeout` errors when creating browser sessions.

**Fix:**
- Retry after a few seconds — usually transient
- For self-hosted: check infrastructure resources
- If persistent, contact support with your run IDs
</Accordion>

### Element & Interaction Issues

<Accordion title="AI clicked the wrong element">
**Symptom:** Recording shows the AI clicking something other than intended.

**Check:** `visible_elements_tree` (element detected?) and `llm_prompt` (target described clearly?)

**Fix:**
- Add distinguishing details: "Click the **blue** Submit button at the **bottom** of the form"
- Reference surrounding text: "Click Download in the row that says 'January 2024'"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Element not found">
**Symptom:** `failure_reason` mentions an element couldn't be found.

**Check:** `screenshot_final` (element visible?) and `visible_elements_tree` (element detected?)

**Likely causes:** Dynamic loading, iframe, below the fold, unusual rendering (canvas, shadow DOM)

**Fix:**
- Add `max_screenshot_scrolls` to capture lazy-loaded content
- Describe elements visually rather than by technical properties
- Add wait or scroll instructions in your prompt
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Date fields entering wrong values">
**Symptom:** Dates entered in wrong format (MM/DD vs DD/MM) or wrong date entirely.

**Check:** `recording` (how did AI interact with the date picker?)

**Fix:**
- Specify exact format: "Enter the date as **15/01/2024** (DD/MM/YYYY format)"
- For date pickers: "Click the date field, then select January 15, 2024 from the calendar"
- If site auto-formats: "Type 01152024 and let the field format it"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Address autocomplete cycling or wrong selection">
**Symptom:** AI keeps clicking through address suggestions in a loop, or selects wrong address.

**Check:** `recording` (is autocomplete dropdown appearing?)

**Fix:**
- Specify selection: "Type '123 Main St' and select the first suggestion showing 'New York, NY'"
- Disable autocomplete: "Type the full address without using autocomplete suggestions"
- Break into steps: "Enter street address, wait for dropdown, select the matching suggestion"
</Accordion>

### Authentication Issues

<Accordion title="Login failed">
**Symptom:** Status is `terminated` with login-related failure reason.

**Check:** `screenshot_final` (error message?) and `recording` (fields filled correctly?)

**Likely causes:** Expired credentials, CAPTCHA, MFA required, automation detected

**Fix:**
- Verify credentials in your credential store
- Use `RESIDENTIAL_ISP` proxy for more stable IPs
- Configure TOTP if MFA is required
- Use a browser profile with an existing session
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CAPTCHA blocked the run">
**Symptom:** `failure_reason` mentions CAPTCHA.

**Fix options:**
1. **Browser profile** — Use an authenticated session that skips login
2. **Human interaction block** — Pause for manual CAPTCHA solving
3. **Different proxy** — Use `RESIDENTIAL_ISP` for static IPs sites trust more
</Accordion>

### Data & Output Issues

<Accordion title="AI hallucinating or inventing data">
**Symptom:** Extracted data contains information not on the page.

**Check:** `screenshot_final` (data visible?) and `llm_response_parsed` (what did AI claim to see?)

**Fix:**
- Add instruction: "Only extract data **visibly displayed** on the page. Return null if not found"
- Make schema fields optional where appropriate
- Add validation: "If price is not displayed, set price to null instead of guessing"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="File downloads not working">
**Symptom:** Files download repeatedly, wrong files, or downloads don't complete.

**Check:** `recording` (download button clicked correctly?) and `downloaded_files` in response

**Fix:**
- Be specific: "Click the **PDF** download button, not the Excel one"
- Add wait time: "Wait for the download to complete"
- For multi-step downloads: "Click Download, then select PDF format, then click Confirm"
</Accordion>

### Environment Issues

<Accordion title="Site showing content in wrong language">
**Symptom:** Site displays in unexpected language based on proxy location.

**Check:** What `proxy_location` is being used? Does site geo-target?

**Fix:**
- Use appropriate proxy: `RESIDENTIAL_US` for English US sites
- Add instruction: "If the site asks for language preference, select English"
- Set language in URL: `https://example.com/en/`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workflow gets stuck in a loop">
**Symptom:** Recording shows AI repeating the same actions without progressing.

**Check:** `recording` (what pattern is repeating?) and conditional block exit conditions

**Fix:**
- Add termination: "STOP if you've attempted this action 3 times without success"
- Add completion markers: "COMPLETE when you see 'Success' message"
- Review loop conditions — ensure exit criteria are achievable
</Accordion>

## When to adjust prompts vs parameters

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Adjust prompt" icon="pen">
    - AI misunderstood what to do
    - Clicked wrong element
    - Ambiguous completion criteria
    - Extracted wrong data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adjust parameters" icon="sliders">
    - Timed out → increase `max_steps`
    - Site blocked → change `proxy_location`
    - Content didn't load → increase `max_screenshot_scrolls`
  </Card>
  <Card title="File a bug" icon="bug">
    - Visible element not detected
    - Standard UI patterns don't work
    - Consistent wrong element despite clear prompts
  </Card>
