Everything in Skyvern — workflows, credentials, runs, API keys — belongs to an **organization**. One is created automatically when you sign up.

## Organization details

Open **Settings** in the sidebar. The **Settings** card at the top shows your current environment and organization. The organization name appears throughout the UI and in API responses.

## Team members

Plans that support multiple users show a **Members** section where you can invite teammates by email and manage who has access to the organization's resources.

<Warning>
When removing a team member, also review your [API keys](/cloud/account-settings/api-keys) — they may have copied keys that remain active.
</Warning>

<Note>
Role-based access control (restricting what individual members can do) is available on **Enterprise** plans. On other plans, all members have full access to the organization's resources.
