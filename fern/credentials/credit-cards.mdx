## Manage Credit Cards
Like passwords, credit cards are managed on the [Skyvern Credentials](https://app.skyvern.com/credentials) page.

### Add a new credit card:

### Delete a credit card:

Click the trash icon and confirm the deletion. If you do this, the credit card will be deleted from Skyvern PERMANENTLY.

### Update a credit card:
<Warning>Skyvern only supports adding and deleting credit cards. To update a credit card, you need to delete the existing credit card and create a new one.</Warning>

## API & SDK
We also have [API and SDK](/api-reference/api-reference/credentials/create-credential) supports for credit card management:

### Create a new credit card:

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="python"
from skyvern import Skyvern
skyvern = Skyvern(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
await skyvern.create_credential(
    name="My Credit Card",
    credential_type="credit_card",
    credential={
        "card_number": "4242424242424242",
        "card_cvv": "424",
        "card_exp_month": "12",
        "card_exp_year": "2028",
        "card_brand": "visa",
        "card_holder_name": "John Doe",
    },
)
```

```bash title="curl"
curl -X POST https://api.skyvern.com/v1/credentials \
     -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
      "name": "My Credit Card",
      "credential_type": "credit_card",
      "credential": {
        "card_number": "4242424242424242",
        "card_cvv": "424",
        "card_exp_month": "12",
        "card_exp_year": "2028",
        "card_brand": "visa",
        "card_holder_name": "John Doe"
      }
    }'
```
</CodeBlocks>

### Delete a credit card:
