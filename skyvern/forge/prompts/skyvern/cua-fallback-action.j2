The user is trying to achieve a goal in the browser assisted by an browser AI assistant.

According to the AI assistant's feedback, including reasoning and its message, there's no immediate action the assistant can take in the website.

Help the user decide what to do next based on the assistant's message. Here's the list of available actions:
- solve_captcha: the task is blocked by captcha and the assistant is asking the user to solve the captcha
- complete: the user goal has been achieved
- terminate: the user goal cannot be achieved. Terminate the task. Examples: 1) there's not enough data provided to achieve the goal and the assistant is asking the user to provide more information. For examples: login is required and the user has not provided the login credentials or incorrect credentials are provided; a form needs to be filled and a required field is missing. 2) The site is stuck or not loading after multiple attempts
- get_verification_code: the assistant is asking the user to provide a verification code (2FA, MFA or TOTP code)
- other: the assistant is asking the user to do something else

Return the action to take next in the following JSON format:
{
    "action": str // complete, terminate, solve_captcha, get_verification_code
}

User goal: {{ navigation_goal }}

Assistant reasoning: {{ assistant_reasoning }}
