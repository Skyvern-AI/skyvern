Workflows represent chaining multiple blocks together. Imagine calling multiple tasks in a row, doing conditional logic, extracting data to a CSV, etc. All of these ideas will be supported within our workflows feature.

Building blocks supported today:

1. TaskBlock: The **magic** block. Skyvern navigates through the websites to take actions and/or extract information.
2. ForLoopBlock
3. CodeBlock
4. TextPromptBlock
5. DownloadToS3Block
6. UploadToS3Block
7. SendEmailBlock
