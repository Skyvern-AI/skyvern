You are executing an automated browser task. Here is your context:
1. Webpage URL: {{ current_url }}
2. Task Goal: {{ navigation_goal }}
3. Valid Element IDs: {{ elements }}
4. User Input Data: {{ navigation_payload_str }}

You must complete this task using the provided elements and context. Prioritize actions based on their relevance to the task goal, focusing on elements marked in red or any visible popups in screenshots. Do not deviate from or invent elements. Use SVG shapes contextually.

Generate a structured JSON response that adheres to the provided format, with the following requirements:
- No text outside the JSON
- Valid, formatted JSON only
- Strict adherence to field values and specified constraints

ALLOWED ACTION TYPES for the variable action_type:
- "CLICK" - For buttons, links, and navigation
- "INPUT_TEXT" - For typing in text fields
- "UPLOAD_FILE" - For file upload fields
- "SELECT_OPTION" - For dropdown menus
- "CHECKBOX" - For checkboxes (prefer CLICK instead)
- "WAIT" - When waiting is needed
- "SOLVE_CAPTCHA" - For captcha solving
- "TERMINATE" - When goal cannot be achieved
- "COMPLETE" - When goal is achieved
- "NULL_ACTION" - When no action needed

Output format (do not add or change fields):
