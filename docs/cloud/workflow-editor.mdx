slug: cloud/workflow-editor
---

The workflow editor is a visual canvas where you connect blocks into a sequence to build multi-step automations. It opens when you create a new workflow or click the pencil icon on an existing one.

## Editor layout

| Area | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Header bar** (top) | Workflow title (click to rename), Parameters button, Save button, Template toggle, History button, and Run button |
| **Canvas** (center) | Visual graph of blocks connected in sequence. Zoom with scroll wheel and pan by dragging the background. |
| **Configuration panel** (right) | Appears when you click a block. Shows that block's settings form. |

---

## Adding blocks

1. Click the **+** button on any edge (the connecting line between blocks)
2. A panel opens showing available block types grouped by category
3. Click a block type to insert it at that position in the sequence

When you create a blank workflow, click the **+** on the start edge to add your first block.

## Configuring a block

Click any block on the canvas to open its configuration panel on the right side. Each block type has different fields — see [Block Configuration](/cloud/block-configuration) for the full reference.

Fields shared across most blocks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Label** | Display name shown on the canvas. Also determines how you reference this block's output in other blocks (`{{ label_output }}`). |
| **Continue on Failure** | When enabled, the workflow continues to the next block even if this one fails |
| **Continue to Next Loop on Failure** | Only appears inside loops. Skips to the next iteration instead of stopping the workflow. |

Browser-based blocks (Navigation, Action, Extraction, Login, File Download) share additional common fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **URL** | Starting URL. Leave blank to continue from where the previous block left off. |
| **Engine** | AI engine: Skyvern 1.0 or Skyvern 2.0 |
| **Max Retries** | Retry attempts on failure (default: 0) |
| **Max Steps Override** | Cap the number of AI steps |
| **TOTP Identifier** | Link TOTP credentials for 2FA handling |
| **Error Code Mapping** | Map error conditions to custom codes (JSON) |

---

## Connecting blocks

Blocks execute in sequence from top to bottom. The visual edges between blocks represent execution order.

**Conditional blocks** create branches — each branch connects to a different sequence of blocks and merges back at a common point.

**Loop blocks** contain child blocks that repeat for each item in the loop's list.

---

## Deleting blocks

Click the **three-dot menu** (dots icon) on a block's header to open a dropdown, then select **Delete Block**.

---

## Saving your workflow

<Warning>
Workflows are **not auto-saved**. Click the **Save** button (disk icon) in the header bar to persist your changes. If you navigate away with unsaved changes, the editor warns you.
</Warning>

The **Run** button also saves before starting execution.

---

## Header bar actions

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Save** (disk icon) | Save the current workflow definition |
| **Template** (bookmark icon) | Toggle whether this workflow is saved as an organization template |
| **History** (clock icon) | View past runs of this workflow |
| **Parameters** | Open/close the parameters panel (see [Workflow Parameters](/cloud/workflow-parameters)) |
| **Run** (play icon) | Save and start a new execution (see [Running Workflows](/cloud/running-workflows)) |
