### Parameters

#### proxy_location

`proxy_location` works the same way it does for Task runs:

- Defaults to `RESIDENTIAL` (random US residential proxy)
- Accepts any country preset like `RESIDENTIAL_GB` or the ISP pool `RESIDENTIAL_ISP`
- Accepts a GeoTarget object for granular state/city runs (e.g., `{"country": "US", "subdivision": "NY", "city": "Brooklyn"}`)

Each run can override whatever is saved on the workflow definition. See [Proxy & Geo Targeting](/running-tasks/proxy-location) for the full option list and sample payloads.
