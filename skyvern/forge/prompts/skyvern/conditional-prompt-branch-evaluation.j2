Evaluate if the following condition(s) are TRUE or FALSE.
{% if conditions|length == 1 %}
Condition: {{ conditions[0] }}
{% else %}
{% for condition in conditions %}
Condition {{ loop.index }}: {{ condition }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% if context_json %}

Use this context to understand variable values:
{{ context_json }}
{% endif %}

For each condition, provide IN THIS ORDER:
1. "rendered_condition": REPLACE all variable names and references with their actual values.
   - REMOVE the variable names entirely and put only the values in their place
   - Do NOT include both the variable name and value - only the value
   - Example: "base_date is same as date_3" → "01-25-2026 is same as 01-25-2026" (NOT "base_date 01-25-2026 is same as date_3 01-25-2026")
   - Example: "date shown in the website is not same with date_3" → "01-27-2026 is not same with 01-07-2025"
2. "reasoning": Explain your reasoning for evaluating the rendered condition. Compare the actual values.
3. "result": The boolean result (true/false) based on the rendered condition.
