When you run a task from the [Discover page](/cloud/getting-started/run-a-task), you're taken to the live execution screen where you can watch the browser in real time.

## The execution screen

The execution view has three panels:

| Panel | What it shows |
|-------|---------------|
| **Left: Task configuration** | The block being executed, its URL, and prompt. A status badge shows the current state. |
| **Center: Live browser** | Real-time view of the browser. You see pages load, forms fill, and buttons click. |
| **Right: Agent logs** | Real-time LLM reasoning and action decisions. Shows why the AI made each choice. |

## When the live view is available

The live browser stream is active while the task is still in progress:

| Status | Live view |
|--------|-----------|
| `created` | Waiting to start |
| `queued` | Waiting for a browser |
| `running` | **Active**: the browser is navigating |
| `paused` | Waiting for human interaction |
| `completed` | Stream closed. View the recording instead. |
| `failed` | Stream closed. View the recording instead. |
| `terminated` | Stream closed. View the recording instead. |
| `timed_out` | Stream closed. View the recording instead. |
| `canceled` | Stream closed. View the recording instead. |

Once a task reaches a final state, the live stream closes. Open the run from **Runs** in the sidebar to access the full recording, screenshots, and action history.

## Taking control of the browser

The **Take Control** button lets you interact directly with the browser. This is useful when:
- A CAPTCHA appears that the AI can't solve
- The site has an unusual login flow
- You need to navigate past an unexpected popup

Click **Take Control** to start interacting. Your mouse and keyboard input goes directly to the browser. Click **Stop Controlling** to hand control back to the AI.

<Warning>
Taking control pauses the AI agent. Remember to release control so the agent can resume.
</Warning>

---

## Stopping a running task

You can cancel a task at any time while it's running or queued. Click the **Cancel** button in the task header. A confirmation dialog appears before the task is stopped. The task transitions to `canceled` and any configured webhook fires with the canceled status.

<Note>
Credits for actions already taken are still consumed. Canceling stops future actions but does not refund past ones.
</Note>

## Reviewing results

Once a task finishes, open it from **Runs** to see the full results. The run detail page has five tabs:

- **Overview**: The AI's reasoning timeline alongside browser screenshots. Each Thought, Block, and Action card shows what the agent saw and why it acted.
- **Output**: The complete JSON output and any downloaded files.
- **Parameters**: The configuration you submitted: URL, prompt, engine, proxy location, webhook URL, data schema, and other settings.
- **Recording**: Full video replay of the browser session. Every task is recorded automatically.
- **Code**: Auto-generated Python code to reproduce this task via the API or SDK (when code generation is enabled).

For a full walkthrough of each tab, see [Run Details](/cloud/viewing-results/run-details).
