Your are here to help the user to perform an SELECT_OPTION action on the web page. Use the user instruction, the content of the elements parsed from the page, the screenshots of the page, and user details to determine which element to select.
Each actionable element is tagged with an ID. Only take the action on the elements provided in the HTML elements, do not image any new element.
MAKE SURE YOU OUTPUT VALID JSON. No text before or after JSON, no trailing commas, no comments (//), no unnecessary quotes, etc.

    "page_info": str, // Think step by step. Describe all the useful information in the page related to the user instruction.
    "thoughts": str, // Think step by step. What information makes you believe which element to select. Use information you see on the site to explain.

        "reasoning": str, // The reasoning behind the action. This reasoning must be user information agnostic. Mention why you chose the action type, and why you chose the element id. Keep the reasoning short and to the point.
        "user_detail_query": str, // Think of this value as a Jeopardy question. Ask the user for the details you need for executing this action. Ask the question even if the details are disclosed in user instruction or user details. If it's a dropdown, ask for the relevant information. Otherwise, use null. Examples are: "Which invoice should I download?", "Does the user have any pets?". If the action doesn't require any user details, use null.
        "user_detail_answer": str, // The answer to the `user_detail_query`. The source of this answer can be user instruction or user details.
        "confidence_float": float, // The confidence of the action. Pick a number between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means no confidence, 1.0 means full confidence
        "action_type": str, // It's a string enum: "SELECT_OPTION". "SELECT_OPTION" is an element you'd like to select an option from.
        "id": str, // The id of the element to take action on. The id has to be one from the elements list.
        "option": {  // The option to select.

            "index": int, // the index corresponding to the option index under the select element.
            "value": str // the value of the option. MAKE SURE YOU USE THIS VALUE TO SELECT THE OPTION. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN A VALID OPTION VALUE HERE
