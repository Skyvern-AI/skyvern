Every run generates artifacts—recordings, screenshots, logs, and more. Use these to understand what happened, debug failures, and verify the AI made the right decisions.

This page covers how to retrieve artifacts and what each type tells you.

---

## Retrieve artifacts

Use `get_run_artifacts` with the `run_id` from your task or workflow run:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
artifacts = await client.get_run_artifacts(run_id)

for artifact in artifacts:
    print(f"{artifact.artifact_type}: {artifact.signed_url}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const artifacts = await client.getRunArtifacts(runId);

for (const artifact of artifacts) {
  console.log(`${artifact.artifact_type}: ${artifact.signed_url}`);
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID/artifacts" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SKYVERN_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Example response:**

```json
[
  {
    "artifact_id": "a_486305284826607484",
    "artifact_type": "recording",
    "uri": "s3://skyvern-artifacts/.../recording.webm",
    "signed_url": "https://skyvern-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/.../recording.webm?...",
    "task_id": "tsk_486305246171901814",
    "step_id": "stp_486305250466869112",
    "run_id": "tsk_v2_486305187432193504",
    "workflow_run_id": "wr_486305187432193510",
    "organization_id": "o_485917350850524254",
    "created_at": "2026-01-20T11:52:52.083001",
    "modified_at": "2026-01-20T11:52:52.083003"
  }
]
```

The `signed_url` is a pre-signed URL valid for a limited time. Download or view it immediately.

## Filter by artifact type

To get only specific artifact types, pass `artifact_type`:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Get only recordings and final screenshots
artifacts = await client.get_run_artifacts(
    run_id,
    artifact_type=["recording", "screenshot_final"]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const artifacts = await client.getRunArtifacts(runId, {
  artifact_type: ["recording", "screenshot_final"],
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID/artifacts?artifact_type=recording&artifact_type=screenshot_final" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SKYVERN_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Artifact types reference

### Visual artifacts

These show you what the browser looked like at various points.

| Type | What it contains | Use this to |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `recording` | Full video of the browser session (WebM) | Watch the entire run, see exactly what happened |
| `screenshot_final` | Screenshot when the run ended | Check the final state—did it end on the right page? |
| `screenshot_action` | Screenshot taken after each action | See the page state after each click, type, or navigation |
| `screenshot_llm` | Screenshot sent to the LLM for decision-making | Understand what the AI "saw" when it made each decision |

**Debugging tip:** If the run failed, start with `screenshot_final` to see where it stopped, then watch the `recording` to see how it got there.

### AI reasoning artifacts

These show you why the AI made each decision.

| Type | What it contains | Use this to |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `llm_prompt` | The prompt sent to the LLM | See exactly what instructions the AI received |
| `llm_request` | Full request including context | Check if the right context was included |
| `llm_response` | Raw LLM response | See the AI's unprocessed output |
| `llm_response_parsed` | Parsed response (extracted actions) | Understand what actions the AI decided to take |

**Debugging tip:** If the AI did something unexpected, check `llm_prompt` to see if your prompt was interpreted correctly, then `llm_response_parsed` to see what action it extracted.

### Page structure artifacts

These show how Skyvern interpreted the page.

| Type | What it contains | Use this to |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `visible_elements_tree` | DOM tree of visible elements | See which elements Skyvern detected |
| `visible_elements_tree_trimmed` | Trimmed tree (sent to LLM) | See what the AI could "see" |
| `visible_elements_id_css_map` | CSS selectors for each element | Debug element targeting issues |
| `html_scrape` | Full HTML captured during scraping | Inspect the raw page structure |
| `html_action` | HTML captured after an action | See how the page changed after each action |

**Debugging tip:** If the AI couldn't find an element, check `visible_elements_tree` to see if it was detected. If not, the element might be in an iframe, dynamically loaded, or outside the viewport.

### Log artifacts

These contain structured execution data.

| Type | What it contains | Use this to |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `skyvern_log` | Formatted execution logs | Read through the run step-by-step |
| `skyvern_log_raw` | Raw JSON logs | Parse programmatically for automation |
| `browser_console_log` | Browser console output | Debug JavaScript errors on the page |

**Debugging tip:** `skyvern_log` is human-readable and shows the flow of execution. Start here for an overview before diving into specific artifacts.

### Network artifacts

| Type | What it contains | Use this to |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `har` | HTTP Archive (network requests/responses) | Debug API calls, check for failed requests, see response data |
| `trace` | Playwright trace file | Replay the session in Playwright Trace Viewer |

**Debugging tip:** The HAR file captures every network request. If a form submission failed, check the HAR to see if the request was sent and what the server responded.

### File artifacts

| Type | What it contains | Use this to |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `pdf` | PDF files generated or downloaded | Access downloaded documents |
| `script_file` | Generated Playwright scripts | See the code Skyvern would use to repeat this task |

|-------|------|-------------|
| `artifact_id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `artifact_type` | string | Type (see tables above) |
| `uri` | string | Internal storage path |
| `signed_url` | string \| null | Pre-signed URL for downloading |
| `task_id` | string \| null | Associated task ID |
| `step_id` | string \| null | Associated step ID |

## Example: Debug a failed login

Here's a complete example of using artifacts to debug a login failure:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import asyncio

async def debug_failed_run(run_id: str):
    # 1. Get the run to see what failed
    run = await client.get_run(run_id)
    print(f"Status: {run.status}")
    print(f"Failure reason: {run.failure_reason}")

    # 2. Get key artifacts
    artifacts = await client.get_run_artifacts(
        run_id,
        artifact_type=[
            "recording",
            "screenshot_final",
            "llm_response_parsed",
            "skyvern_log"
        ]
    )

    # 3. Organize by type
    by_type = {}
    for a in artifacts:
        by_type[a.artifact_type] = a.signed_url

    # 4. Print URLs for manual inspection
    print("\n=== Debug artifacts ===")
    if "screenshot_final" in by_type:
        print(f"Final screenshot: {by_type['screenshot_final']}")
    if "recording" in by_type:
        print(f"Recording: {by_type['recording']}")
    if "skyvern_log" in by_type:
        print(f"Execution log: {by_type['skyvern_log']}")

    # 5. Download and parse the LLM response to see what action was attempted
    if "llm_response_parsed" in by_type:
        import httpx
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as http:
            response = await http.get(by_type["llm_response_parsed"])
            print(f"\nLast AI decision:\n{response.text[:500]}...")

asyncio.run(debug_failed_run("tsk_v2_486305187432193504"))
```

```typescript TypeScript
async function debugFailedRun(runId: string) {
  // 1. Get the run to see what failed
  const run = await client.getRun(runId);
  console.log(`Status: ${run.status}`);
  console.log(`Failure reason: ${run.failure_reason}`);

  // 2. Get key artifacts
  const artifacts = await client.getRunArtifacts(runId, {
    artifact_type: [
      "recording",
      "screenshot_final",
      "llm_response_parsed",
      "skyvern_log"
    ]
  });

  // 3. Organize by type
  const byType: Record<string, string> = {};
  for (const a of artifacts) {
    if (a.signed_url) {
      byType[a.artifact_type] = a.signed_url;
    }
  }

  // 4. Print URLs for manual inspection
  console.log("\n=== Debug artifacts ===");
  if (byType["screenshot_final"]) {
    console.log(`Final screenshot: ${byType["screenshot_final"]}`);
  }
  if (byType["recording"]) {
    console.log(`Recording: ${byType["recording"]}`);
  }
  if (byType["skyvern_log"]) {
    console.log(`Execution log: ${byType["skyvern_log"]}`);
  }

  // 5. Download and parse the LLM response to see what action was attempted
  if (byType["llm_response_parsed"]) {
    const response = await fetch(byType["llm_response_parsed"]);
    const text = await response.text();
    console.log(`\nLast AI decision:\n${text.slice(0, 500)}...`);
  }
}

debugFailedRun("tsk_v2_486305187432193504");
```

```bash cURL
#!/bin/bash

RUN_ID="tsk_v2_486305187432193504"

# 1. Get the run to see what failed
echo "Fetching run status..."
curl -X GET "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SKYVERN_API_KEY" \
  | jq '{status: .status, failure_reason: .failure_reason}'

# 2. Get key artifacts
echo -e "\nFetching debug artifacts..."
ARTIFACTS=$(curl -s -X GET \
  "https://api.skyvern.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID/artifacts?artifact_type=recording&artifact_type=screenshot_final&artifact_type=llm_response_parsed&artifact_type=skyvern_log" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SKYVERN_API_KEY")

# 3. Extract URLs for each artifact type
echo -e "\n=== Debug artifacts ==="
echo "$ARTIFACTS" | jq -r '
  map(select(.artifact_type == "screenshot_final") | .signed_url) | first
  | "Final screenshot: \(.)"'

echo "$ARTIFACTS" | jq -r '
  map(select(.artifact_type == "recording") | .signed_url) | first
  | "Recording: \(.)"'

echo "$ARTIFACTS" | jq -r '
  map(select(.artifact_type == "skyvern_log") | .signed_url) | first
  | "Execution log: \(.)"'

# 4. Download and preview the LLM response
LLM_RESPONSE_URL=$(echo "$ARTIFACTS" | jq -r '
  map(select(.artifact_type == "llm_response_parsed") | .signed_url) | first')

if [ "$LLM_RESPONSE_URL" != "null" ]; then
  echo -e "\nLast AI decision:"
  curl -s "$LLM_RESPONSE_URL" | head -c 500
  echo "..."
fi
